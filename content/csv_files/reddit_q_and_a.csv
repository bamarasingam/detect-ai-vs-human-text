Why do we leave the tails on shrimp? Especially in dishes that shouldn’t need our hands like noodle dishes.,"So my family was poor for a long time and scratched for every nice thing. Most of our clothes were hand-me-downs and I only ever had like 2 pairs of shoes. 

But one time my parents took us to a really nice restaurant (I think it was probably like a Ruby Tuesday's, but by our standards, it was a 5 star place) and my brother (around 12yo) decided he wanted to try shrimp. So he ordered a big bowl of shrimp alfredo and it came with their tails on. He didn't know any better and apparently none of us were paying attention to him, so he ate the whole bowl (because wasting food was a terrible thing in our family) with their tails on. 

In the end we asked how he liked it and he struggled to put on a grateful smile and said, ""it was good, but it was crunchy and I think I have it stuck in my teeth."" And that's when we finally realized he had eaten the tails. All the tails. Because we don't waste food."
What to do with 400 pounds of hamburgers and hotdogs?,"Hundred percent I'd chop up those burgers for your meatloaf. I might keep some for a hamburger special. If the patties were preformed, its a bit more expensive than buying the tube of meat, so there is a bit of a loss there

If I could toss the creativity around to use up both, turn the hamburger into chili, chop up excess veg into a slaw, sell chili cheese dog at a markup on a nice toasted bun. No one really wants to find bits of hot dog in something.

The harder part is what to do with the hotdogs."

"Making Ivan Ramen's ""Vegetable fat""?","Love your dedication. I'm Ivan's chef and wanted to fill you in on the vegetable fat. Let's make 1L of product. Ingredients needed: 18g kombu powder, 6g aonori, 6g chipotle powder, 1L canola oil, 100g whole peeled garlic cloves. 

Using a heavy bottomed pot add canola and garlic and cook over low heat until garlic is beyond tender but do not allow caramelization. 

Remove from heat and strain garlic. Reserve garlic for another use. Allow oil to cool and add remaining ingredients to oil. Use an immersion blender to disperse dry ingredients. Allow to sit 24 hours before use. Contents will settle so stir really well before using.

Does bay leaf really make a difference?,"If you want to get an idea of the flavour of bay leaves, warm up some milk to boiling point with a couple of dried leaves, switch off the heat and let it infuse for 15 minutes. It isn't mild by any means (though nor is it strident like rosemary or oregano) - but it is easy to overlook in a complex dish because it has a sort of alto/tenor ""inner voice"" quality which doesn't draw attention to itself.

You can use the milk mixture to make any white sauce, especially with fish (eg a British fish pie). It also makes outstanding egg custard, better than vanilla IMO in a sort of medieval-hipster way. Another excellent recipe is Marcella Hazan's [pork stewed with porcini and juniper](https://rhubarbfool.co.uk/tag/marcella-hazan/) (I wouldn't bother to crumble them). There is a lot going on there but the bay is an important part to my taste.

I find the taste of fresh bay leaves unpleasant and always used dried. They store reasonably well as best I can tell.

Edit: opinion on fresh versus dried withdrawn for further testing."

Would it be bad etiquette to ask a restaurant for a recipe?,"It's just like asking out a potential romantic partner- not at all rude to ask, but if you get a ""no"" and kick up a fuss you'd be a total asshole.

Many times those of us in the industry have no problem with people knowing our recipes because that's not the hard part- it really is more about the technique, reliably sourcing great ingredients, making everything from scratch even when a dish only calls for an ounce, and getting your mise en place set perfectly. If you take the recipe home and don't get good results, you'll come back because you know you don't have the chops. If you take the recipe home and get great results, you'll come back because you know exactly how much work we did to get it right, and having someone else do that for you is absolutely worth it. Either way we win- and we get to be gracious doing it."

"Update to “Is it overkill to spatchcock, buttermilk marinade, AND rub an herb butter on a roast chicken?”",Nice work! Pan drippings will definitely burn at those temps but you can add a little water/beer/stock to the pan and keep it topped off. If you do this without the tinfoil in a roasting pan (I've even had good luck with aluminum baking trays which sounds similar to what you used) you can scrape up all the stuff on the bottom and make a nice jus. The liquid keeps the drippings from burning.

What's up with mac'n'cheese?,"On a side note, I recommend this [video](https://youtu.be/MrKafmzGNJc) for the history of mac n cheese."
Why are so many Americans obsessed with “kosher salt”?,"Kosher salt has larger crystals than table salt, making it easier to grab and season food with, making it less dense (and thus easier to add by hand without small volume differences making a large salinity difference) and (for some varieties, namely Diamond brand kosher salt) giving it a much nicer texture when it hasn't dissolved into the food. This means professional chefs and most cookbook writers use kosher salt for everything and thus they will typically specify ""kosher salt"" in the ingredients, otherwise the same amount of table salt will make the food very salty. Kosher salt is also not iodized, and some people dislike the taste of iodized salt, especially chefs, who often care a lot about how food tastes.

As for what's up outside of America, I can't really say."

"What are the differences in ingredients / restaurant food supply sources between low end, middle range, and high end dining establishments?","I have been in restaurant food supplies for 18 years and worked for 6 different suppliers. I don't think I even know where to begin with debunking all the misinformation in this thread already. 

This is a much more huge and complex question than most people realize. Even the high end dining establishments with two very similar menus can have two completely different sourcing strategies. There are some kitchens that do so many things completely from scratch but I think people would be surprised to find out how many items come premade in high end kitchens as well. Take for example something as completely simple as French Fries. I can walk into a kitchen that serves $40-$50 entrees and find a box of frozen Lamb Weston french fries that are hand cut with skin on and been properly washed, blanched and frozen. I can also walk into a low end kitchen and find a Lamb Weston box of french fries but those are scraps from cuts that have just been frozen. Same manufacturer, same plant, same machine, it just a different french fry that gets boxed. Fewer than 5% of restaurants cut their own french fries and given the quality of the more expensive frozen fries, there isn't always a reason to. You would be surprised at how far food science has come and what items are coming from premade and frozen. There are different tiers of frozen though. You will find a freezer in every higher end restaurant. Fewer than 1% of restaurants use no frozen items. 

I see a lot of misinformation on produce supply as well. The small independent produce supplier has the same box of Mann's lettuce as the big boys. Farms want to most stable supplier to offer them contracts on their supply. So often times the first pick of the fields go to the big guys. In fact US Foods and SYSCO both have employees that go to farms and pick what fields they want their supply to come from. Plus they have their own distribution so often the produce makes it onto a truck within 48 hours of being harvested. The small guys have to wait for the rest of the fields to be shipped to terminal markets and buy from whole sale suppliers there often meaning they hold product longer. Also smaller suppliers do not have food safety measures in place. The reason to go with a produce specific company for higher end restaurants is that they offer more specialty items, can make up for poor quality by doing 2nd runs same day and offer more delivery days. All of this could relate to meat as well. 

Frozen gets a bad rap but often times chefs prefer some things frozen. Take green peas for example. They can be frozen at peak of freshness whereas most fresh that comes in is hard to keep from getting too soft, so most chefs buy frozen even in scratch kitchens. Bread can very well be another example. Bread can be frozen at peak freshness and thawed and resume at near the same state. A lot of bakery suppliers offer shelf stable bread that is several days old. I have worked for a bakery that does fresh daily bread but how many restaurants get daily deliveries? We may have baked fresh every day but if we deliver a load and it's 3 days until the next delivery you are eating 3-4 day old bread at your higher end restaurant. 

Just throwing out another random example is Hollandaise sauce. Medium to higher end restaurants that do brunch don't always find a benefit of doing their own hollandaise. You'd be surprised at how many buy it in jugs. However, that really expensive shelf stable hollandaise is not the same hollandaise the small diner is buying. Yes you can tell the small diner doesn't make their own hollandaise because it's chalky and not rich. The higher end if very hard to tell.

A common cutting tactic among food distributers is have chefs blind taste test high end pre made products vs their own and it's always surprising how many they cannot find a quality difference. The main point is there are different tiers of premade and quality food. People have a perception of how medium to high end restaurants source and I think you'd be very surprised to go look at the back of house boxes.

Last note is when I'm talking about higher end restaurants I am talking of restaurants with $30-$50 entrees and not Michelin star places. Those are a different beast. Like I said in the beginning there are differences among EVERY restaurant. I can walk you into a place with less than $10 entrees that is all made from scratch and I can walk you into a $30 entrée place that is majority premade higher end products.

Ok really last note now. COVID caused a lot of restaurants to throw out large amounts of inventory and lay off staff so many have no one to prep products now so even more than before is sourcing higher end quality premade and frozen products.

EDIT: thinking about it, we often discuss with chefs what truly counts as ""from scratch"". Less than 100 years ago every chef and even home cook knew how to make cheese. How many restaurants make their own cheese now. I don't know of a single one. If you had a chef from 100 years ago walk into a kitchen today and see chefs using a prepacked cheese, even if it's higher end, they would scoff that they aren't really making their own. However, if a chef adds it to a dish today and the rest is made themselves, they are considered to still have done it from scratch. 

Take milled flour as well. There used to be so many local mills because flour used to go bad quickly! So you had to have it milled close to homes. Flour today has additives in it to make it shelf stable. Virtually every kitchen in the world uses this shelf stable flour with additives and no one bats an eye. Pastry and cakes and anything else made with it is still from scratch but yet if we got a piece of meat or sauce with additives in there we would scoff. 

The point is the industry has continually moved towards products that a short time ago would be considered not fresh or from scratch. The industry is continually moving there and some restaurants are more ahead of the curve than others. I think some of the things we scoff at restaurants for not doing themselves right now will be common place before the end of most of our lives."

Caramel apples are really just that? Raw fruit?,Yeah that's it
I just moved into an apartment that used to be a restaurant. So I have my own personal restaurant-grade wok stove. Got any tips?,"Here's things in random order as I think of them.   

First off, you're gonna burn things. A lot of things. It's a learning experience.  Don't let anyone tell you to turn down the heat.  I mean... turn down the heat for some things, but other things where you need the firepower, learn to use the heat rather than tame it.  

The absolute most important thing to know (outside of the fire extinguisher) is mise en place.  You have literal seconds before things start burning so you don't have time to stop and get something when the train starts rolling.    

Equipment wise, you'll need a ladle (which you already have), a wok spatula, a metal strainer that fits over a pot with the pot, and a bamboo brush. First two are obvious. You'll use one or both tools to manipulate the food.  The metal strainer (google wok strainer, it'll look kinda like a wok but with holes) is to filter food cooked in oil.  The pot holds the oil.  Something without handles is best. Measure your work area to find one that fits the front part.  This is where you effectively oil blanch foods. Use this oil to cook with as well.  

The bamboo brush is how you clean the wok.  After you're done cooking a dish, use the ladle and ladle some water out of the water ""can"".  ""Wash"" (more like rinse) and use the brush to get any food particles.  The wok burner itself should have a drain and a basket to collect food particles.   If it doesn't, dump it in the sink with a strainer.  
Some of the fancier wok setups have a 2nd burner for a pot of water. This is meant to be used for blanching and as a source of water.  Since you don't have this, keep a metal ""pot"" of water around. You don't want to fiddle with the tap during cooking.  
Measure the back part to fit it there.   

Use your knee to adjust the flames.  Things getting out of control or you have to add a few things? Turn it down a little.  Yeah I broke my own rule. It was more meant for ""cook on low"".   

Everyone and their dog says use day old rice for fried rice. This is only true if you don't have a wok burner.  You're one of the few lucky ones that can use fresh rice.  Cook some off 1:1 water:rice.  It's a low ratio.  Spread it out on a plate to cool when cooked.  
Here's where you prep things like eggs/chicken/bbq pork/shrimp/etc.  

When you're ready to cook, oil the rice and set aside.  Oil the wok, add the eggs, and scramble.  Set those aside. Highest heat you can get and oil the wok again (fairly heavily) and dump in the rice.  Break it up as much as you can with the spatula. Basically ""chop"" it.  Toss the rice and continue breaking it up using the back of the ladle in a beating motion. Continue this toss and and beat until your rice toasts. Add in your cooked chicken/pork/shrimp/whatever. Add your eggs, a handful of peas, and bean sprouts. Toss again to incorporate.  Add salt.  Taste.  Adjust with more salt.  Toss once more and plate.  The perfect actually fried rice.  

For something like mixed veg, you want to blanch the veg.  Heat the wok, add in some garlic, then the blanched veg.  Add a seasoning sauce (we had a ""generic"" one with white pepper, chicken powder, salt, and a few other things) but you can use anything you want.   Add in some water and mix in a corn starch slurry.  Heat til thick and plate.  Most of the cooking is done via blanch.   

Chow mein (and veggies), blanch the noodles and drain.  Heat up, oil in, noodles in, water in, soy sauce in.  The water helps distribute the soy evenly.  Cook off the water and you're effectively done.  We used our ""generic"" seasoning but again, use anything you want.  

Any other dishes you're curious about or if you need more than basically a bullet point that I gave above, feel free to ask."

What's the deal with red velvet cake?,"Red velvet was originally a version of chocolate cake made with cocoa powder, buttermilk and vinegar. The chemical reaction between natural cocoa powder which contains anthocyanin, a pH-sensitive antioxidant that reacts to acids and the vinegar and buttermilk caused it to have a red hue. Many bakeries will add food colouring to make the red more vivid. Either way, its chocolatish reddish cake."
Why are some cheeses traditionally sliced in squares (like Cheddar) while some are traditionally sliced in circles (like provolone).,"This Reddit comment is consistent with what I was able to just Google myself: https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1pwyua/eli5_why_does_are_some_cheeses_sliced_in_squares/cd6zbn1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3

* For deli cheeses, they are cut to consumer expectations.  
* For cheeses that have undergone a large amount of modernization for mass manufacture, most likely they will be in square slices better suited to mass production.  
* Traditional cheeses are likely in wheel shapes to allow for even distribution of bacteria, easier ability to apply pressure during the cheese making process, or easier to move from point A to B.  
* Cheeses that rely on mold may have crisp edges that facilitate mold growth.

Depends on tradition, expectation, and demands of production.

This knowledge will become important some day."

"Toasting spices to improve flavor is a common culinary practice. But Western cooks ""bloom"" spices (making them stronger) while Indian cooks ""temper"" spices (making them milder). Blind taste test, what actually happens?","This is a fascinating question and I’m excited to see what seems like a more researched answer from another poster, but here is my pure speculation while we wait:

Heating spices should drive off some of the most volatile aromatic compounds. So in that sense it might “weaken” the more pungent aspects of a spice’s flavor, aligning with the tempering philosophy.

It should also add some amount of toasty flavors to the spices. Which is neither making it stronger nor weaker, but just changing it. 

Heating in oil also should allow many of the flavor compounds to distribute more evenly throughout a dish, which overall may increase the amount of perceptible spice flavor in each bite, which leans towards the blooming philosophy.

So, some of each I guess?"

"Chefs, is it rude to ask for steak well done?","Professional line cook here. Cooks are generally not _insulted_ when someone orders a well-done steak. It does not constitute a judgement on the quality of our product or the qualifications of our team. There are some modifications/requests that _do_ frequently offend the sensibilities of the cook staff, but a well-done temp isn't among them.

An order for a well-done is still upsetting though, for several reasons. A well-done generally takes longer to cook than _anything else_ on the menu, which can drag an order and disrupt the flow of service. Also, good cooks generally like to make good food, and they generally think of a well-done as being bad food. It's dispiriting to take good product (steaks are often the most expensive line item on the food budget, per portion) and be ordered ""ruin"" it. To many cooks it seems irrational or ignorant to order the most expensive thing on the menu, only to have it rendered tough and tasteless. Cooks have an ongoing low-level simmer of contempt for all customers, but being forced to enable their poor judgement in such a way can cause that disdain to boil over.

So while ordering a steak well-done _does upset_ the cooks, it's not exactly _rude_. The cooks are a haughty and judgemental lot, and in their view someone who orders a well-done is perceived as lacking in refinement, knowledge, and/or personal strength of character."
Are there different cuts of meat in different cultures or does everyone basically butcher the same way?,"Yes, different cultures have different cuts of meat, however they mostly all follow the same patterns because the musculoskeletal structure of the animals doesn't change. A good example of this would be the differences in American (US) style butchery and Spanish butchery. The primal cuts are pretty much the same with some debate as to where the major cuts should be made however the sub primal get broken down very differently. Two major factors that affect the subprimal cuts are intended use and cutting equipment. In more industrialized societies you see more of what would be called square cutting, where a butcher breaks the primal down into more uniform cuts based on where it is easiest to cut through the bones with a band saw. In countries with a longer tradition of butchery/charcuterie you see more of what would be called seam butchery where primals are broken down into muscle groups and individual muscles with as little use of a band saw as possible. There are also regional differences in the names given to certain cuts which can lead to confusion as well."

How are different pasta shapes used differently?,"It can be divided into a few main categories. Pasta with ridges holds sauce better. Long pasta goes well with larger pieces e.g. clam or lobster. Spiral shaped pasta collects thicker sauces in the grooves. And then the more obvious, sheets of pasta are for lasagne, various stuffed pasta is for stuffing, jumbo pasta like cannelloni or shells are for baking.

A lot of it comes down to history and tradition too. Certain pastas are more associated with certain sauces. Sort of what your grandmother would make you."
What to do if my Girlfriend has absolutely NO palate.,"In scientific studies, [super tasters actually far prefer saltier foods on average](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2010/06/16/127880219/for-supertasters-a-desire-for-salt-is-in-their-genes) because salt helps mask the bitter flavors that they’re genetically sensitive to.  You can even get a [test to determine whether or not you’re actually a super taster](https://supertaster.com).

Super tasters will also physically have more tastebuds crammed onto their tongues.  You can check this for free [by counting the number of papillae on the tongue](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/super-tasting-science-find-out-if-youre-a-supertaster/) with a drop of blue food coloring, a hole puncher, and some wax paper.

Your wife might be a super taster of some variety, but to be frank, she may also just be stuck in a deeply ingrained pattern of food.  I’ve known people who pull the super taster card, and turn around and consume plenty of things that super tasters should definitely not enjoy.  They’re more likely just stubborn about food, which is a difficult thing to overcome as it’s often established in childhood and has a psychological component—you can’t just get rid of with food you find so delicious anyone should love it.  There are also sensory sensitivities to textures that go beyond super-tasters.

It might be a good start to cook *together* more often.  Maybe follow an exact recipe at first, so neither of you are “allowed” to dictate the flavor (still tame things that aren’t too explorative, pasta pomodoro instead of coratella con carciofi if you catch my drift).  The book “Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat” by Samin Nosrat also makes for a wonderful audio book to listen to together, that might help her understand the way that flavors really work together in creative ways."

Why is my cheese sauce always grainy?,"Some people are suggesting entirely different ingredients like sodium citrate or evaporated milk. Which are fine. But let's fix your actual problems. 

First. Measure out your fat and flour for the roux. On lowish heat make sure if you use butter all the water is evaporated from it - not just melted butter used immediately. Add flour, stir stir stir, cook it down on low heat till it's incorporated and a minute or two past that. 

Then add milk. Add a little at a time. First it clumps terribly then it gets thick and liquid then it gets thin like it's just milk. You use 1 tbsp / 1 tbsp / 1 cup as your ratios.  

Then you keep gently simmering until your bechamel gets actually a bit thick instead of just watery. 

Then you can kill the heat, I just use the lowest heat possible instead. 

Then you add cheese. A little at a time, stir to incorporate. Like maybe a half handful. Make sure you shred your own cheese. 

This will work every time and give you good cheese sauce. You need a shitload of cheese for baked mac and cheese, like, at minimum 1.5 pounds cheese to 1 pound dry pasta.

"Why does Indian take-out rice remain fresh for days, while my homemade rice dries out in a day?","Are you sure your rice is ""drying out""? Quite often what is happening is the starches in the rice recrystallize and the rice *feels* dryer, even though a lot of the moisture is still trapped inside. Different rice varieties have different types of starch which make some more or less susceptible to this effect. Also, addition of oils can have an effect. See more here: https://www.cooksillustrated.com/science/860-articles/story/word-of-the-week-retrogradation

The good news is that often the process is reversed by reheating which melts the starch again. This is why cooking days-old rice (say, for fried rice) doesn't result in super dry tasting rice even though the rice feels pretty dry out of the fridge."

"Demystifying the ""how spicy would you like it on a scale of 1-5?"" question at American Thai restaurants?","Hi I am a Thai chef and can probably answer this question decently. In your run of the mill restaurant it is likely just how much dried pepper they use which is a damn shame. I eat hot food but some places will ruin a dish by just making it dry with the amount of pepper flakes they put on it. Truthfully, you can almost always order a 3 or 2 and it will be fine. Not disgustingly unbalanced but also not missing the heat. Now for the more detailed answer. 

In thai food they don't use chili oil very often. It exists as a product of China but they don't use it nearly at all. Some regional foods are hotter than others and it can determine which type of chili is used. Some use dried, some use less spicy but fresh peppers. Eastern Thai (also called Issan Thai) is the hottest regional cuisine but northern Thai is genrally not that spicy by comparison. I don't believe in artificially scaling heat.  Thai food is all about balance of flavor with heat being a key component. Not all thai food it naturally hot. Some is disturbingly spicy. Next time you go to your local spot, don't order pad thai or massaman curry or something normal like that. Instead try something like;

Laap/Larb/Laab/Meat Salad with stick rice
Kra Prao (or something pronounced like kapow)
Or my favorite, Khao Soi

Laap is a mixed bag on how its made but when done well, it's the absolute best.

How can restaurants afford to serve risotto?,"You can par-cook it ahead of time, but it's tough to get right all the time.  If you use carnarolli instead of arborio, it comes back up to temperature with a slightly better texture (in my opinion).  I worked at a place that did a ton of risotto and we did a few sheet pans on Friday and Saturday nights.  During the week, we were able to do it to order without getting weeded too much.  

It helps to have some sheet pans in the freezer while it's cooking, and also to double stack them - so if you have two sheet pans, use four sheet pans.  As soon as it's coming of the stove, scrape it onto the sheet pans, spread it out evenly with a wet spatula and then into the cooler.  Just like you need to have your iceboat ready for poached shrimp, you ned to have sheet pans cold and also a space reserved on the speed rack before you start cooking the rice.  Also best not to finish with cream or any other dairy until you're doing the pickup from the line.  Just the rice, stock and seasoning.  And another thing: you're shooting for 75-80% of the way cooked, but start getting it out off the pan at about 60-70% of the way, sounds weird, but it will make sense when you do it."

"Everything I read insists that you must rest a grilled steak for 10 min, but then the steak isn't hot when j eat it.

Please help.","Rest for less time, and use a warm plate, but also, the ""rest"" is the time starting the second the steak leaves the grill and ending the second your knife hits the steak. If you pay close attention, you may find that your rest clock is starting a couple minutes after you actually pull it (once you've dealt with shutting off the grill, etc.), and that when it ends you're still gathering utensils, serving up side dishes, pouring a drink, etc. Meaning your ""10 minute"" rest has effectively become 15 or 20 minutes.

The trend in toxic kitchen environments,"It’s perpetuated by hothead chefs and the fraternity idea that everyone has to undergo hazing. Fortunately there are significant improvements I’ve seen in the last couple decades since I started cooking professionally. In my own kitchen, we do not allow yelling, swearing, or publicly dressing-down other cooks. If someone makes a mistake you wait until after service and take them aside to talk about it.

It does mean in some ways things are less efficient as prep cooks don’t have that fire under their ass to produce faster or get screamed at. But we more than make up for that in extremely low turnaround. Our cooks start with us and stay with is so we have great institutional knowledge which saves us a ton of effort in hiring and training. End of the day it works better for morale, morality, and the bottom line.

I also think Gordon Ramsay in particular has a lot of blame on his shoulders for this. He saw the ratings that the shouty chef personality got him on TV and just went with it. The result is generations of cooks who think it’s acceptable to behave like an asshole to coworkers, and highly toxic, macho kitchens that make work unfairly difficult, especially for women and minorities.

EDIT: Sorry, I wasn't clear. I didn't mean to imply that Ramsay started this. The abusive kitchen has existed for a LONG time (read Orwell's Down and Out in Paris and London, or Jacques Pepin's memoirs, E.G.), just that in the age of the celebrity chef, Ramsay became the poster child for the idea that you need to abuse your staff in order to get good results, and consequently, many young cooks these days think it's OK to behave that way because a guy like Gordon Ramsay has given them his blessing. He didn't create abusive chef culture, but he has historically gone out of his way to use his incredibly huge influence to perpetuate it, and it makes me sad to think of the number of young cooks who have had to face abusive, toxic work environments due to Ramsay's wide-reaching influence."

We get A 1/4 cow and the farm just called and said ours is “blueberrying” and it’s just a visual thing and they don’t know why sometimes it happens and we will get $1 off per pound. I have no idea if this is ok or what it is. I can’t find any reference to it.,"From the time I spent as a Meat Inspector, this was something that happened fairly rarely but no one really knew a cause. Many seasoned butchers tended to suspect it happens because there was not a great bleed and enough draining time at slaughter. It tends to be more common in pigs that are electrically stunned. It also doesn’t show up on a fresh carcass, but shows up as the carcass ages and progresses through the rigor process. 

It mainly just doesn’t look great. There shouldn’t be actually any residual blood and it should not impact flavor or your ability to cook with it."

"Are there ""movements"" in the history of the culinary arts, as there is in music, painting, etc?","Yes, there have been plenty of movements since the onset of 'haute cuisine'. There was the transition from French style dining (where the cooks would create an impressive ""display"" table for each course that was laden with food, and the diners would stay seated while the tables were taken in and out of the room) to Russian style dining (courses served pre-plated), the huuuuge shift to nouvelle cuisine, which lost a lot of the heavy sauces and extremely fatty, dense dishes in favor of lighter, fresher plates that is still a very persistent aesthetic today.

More recently, there was the food truck fad, the fusion fad, the molecular gastronomy fad, the farm to table movement, the nose to tail movement, etc etc etc. Right now the world is very focused on environmentally sound methods of eating, like minimizing waste and re-using things - to the point where it's a useless aesthetic in most restaurants (think about all the trendy restaurants that use mason jars for their cocktails - the idea obviously is that they're rustically re-using those jars and that's what they're trying to imply about their food, but the reality of course is that they buy those new and solely for the purpose of containing drinks).

They then cut the dough into weighted portions and place them on stackable trays that go into the walk-in refrigerator to rise and age. They can then take out just a tray or two at a time to get up to temperature for actual assembly. As long as the dough stays in the fridge, it typically won't overproof before they use it up.

Depending on recipe, they might make the dough the same day or even the day before.

Suggestions for Culinary School type exercises for a home cook?,"This was effectively my Culinary Foundations 1/2 class:

Buy a massive bag of carrots, potatoes, and onions, and get chopping. Download and print a  knife cuts guide. Learn large dice, then cut that into medium and small. Cut batons, cut that into small dice. Cut julienne, cut that into brunoise. Make sure your knife is sharp as all fuck. Go \*slow\* and be super precise at first. Make them perfect, don't go for speed. You'll get faster over time. Practice this literally like 15-30 minutes per day every day (or more if you like), because that's how you get good. That's how I spent the first few months of culinary school.

Learn how to emulsify a vinaigrette from scratch. Make mayonnaise from scratch. Make stock, and then learn to make the mother sauces (Instant pot is fucking fabulous for this, by the way...it's good to learn how to make a chicken stock from scratch once and skim it and stuff, but honestly if you have the IP don't bother after that, and don't bother making beef or veal stock without one).

learn how to make consomme.

Move onto making the perfect seared airline chicken breast and steak. Key if you're cooking at home though is to dry the meat in the fridge uncovered overnight, you get a much better crust that way.

Learn how to make a pan sauce from the pan you've cooked your meats in.

Learn to poach chicken and fish in a flavorful broth.

Learn to make great polenta, rice, rice pilaf, and a couple other grains of your choice.

Learn how to properly blanch veggies and finish them in a nice buttery sauce.

Learn how to make a roast. Learn how to braise (in school we made a cartouche--a braising lid out of parchment paper)

Practice some basic plating. Everyone has different styles, so spend some time googling around and see what you like. Cutting meats on a bias and trimming veggies on a bias makes things hecka fancy looking and takes no extra time.

LEARN HOW TO SEASON WITH SALT PROPERLY. If you're not sure, keep adding more and more and tasting every single fucking thing every step of the way until it's too much. Most of the time people don't realize how much salt things need.

&#x200B;

Most importantly though--learn the food science. Culinary school didn't teach as much of this as I would have liked, but it's so goddamn important to know if you want to be able to get very good. Otherwise you're just repeating what you've practiced, and that might not be the best approach if you don't understand why what you're doing is great. I always like to call Serious Eats my second culinary school for this reason."
Why do I have to boil my pasta for so much longer than the package recommends?,What altitude are you?   High altitude cooking needs longer times.
Why does yogurt look and taste different from sour cream when both are the product of the same process i.e acid acting on protien,"The microbiology here is way more complicated than you are thinking. The many variables and subtle interactions can make a huge difference in what you get. 

They aren't the same because they start with different materials (milk vs cream), use different cultures (mostly lactobacillus spp vs mostly thermophilic spp), and are cultured under different conditions (warm vs hot). Every one of these variables has biological and chemical effects that can drastically change the end product. 

Compare that to cheesemakling; you can start with the same material, use nearly the exact same processes, but if you change one tiny thing (say, the temperature, or the size you cut curds) you get a totally different cheese."

Why does butter change the flavor of steak so dramatically?,"Personally, I have found butter to add beneficial flavour to all meat.  I can't think of any that doesn't benefit.  Beef, pork, chicken, lamb, goat, fish, shellfish.  All better with butter.

I think there is a stronger tradition of butter with beef because traditionally you could have gotten those two from the same farmer.

As for why beef tastes better with butter then oil.  I think it has to do with our taste sense of fats/lipids.  So recently there has been the discovery of g-coupled protein receptors for fats.  So we have dedicated taste receptors for fats/fatty acids. 

Now if you look at the chemical composition of butter and oil there's one stark difference.  The lipids in milk/butter are shorter (primarily of carbon chains of 4, 6, 8 and 10).  The lipids derived from plants tend to be longer (carbon chains of 14, 16 and 18 being the most common).  Interesting, looking at beef fat(tallow, also other animal based fats are similar) it is very similar to plant fats with carbon chains of 14, 16 and 18 being predominant.

So my theory is that these short lipids (C:4-10) hit our lipid g-coupled protein receptors on our tounges different and butter fills in that flavour profile.  For one, smaller molecules have more mobility and could potentially get to our lipid receptors more readily then longer chain fats.  Also, the receptors themselves could be more susceptible to shorter chain fats much like our amino acid receptors are most susceptible to glutamate.

And I do think it's the fats instead of some other flavour in butter because fats+water in butter makes up 98%-99% of its composition.  The others will help, but this is how I see it."

"I just watched a cooking show, where an Italian chef was frying off prawn shells with I think shallots and garlic etc, and he asked for ice cubes?","He’s using ice cubes instead of water just to help rapidly cool the pan and halt the cooking exactly at the point he wants it. He’s just putting together a really quick shrimp stock. Since it’s being done on the fly in a saute pan, he doesn’t have the luxury of slowly coaxing the flavor out of those shells over lower heat, so what he’s doing is using a ripping hot saute pan and blasting the aromatics and shells with high heat (which is prone to burning) and instead of using water, the ice cubes stop that intense high heat cooking at precisely the moment he wants to. They melt, everything mingles together a bit, and you have basically, an instant, fresh shrimp stock. 🤌"

Knife sharpener said my knives are really poor quality. Thoughts?,"Pro chef, 20 years.

People who sharpen knives for a living rarely use them for a living.  Or if they do, they don’t use them like chefs do.  Those are definitely some higher end knives.  I wouldn’t let anyone else sharpen them, learn to do it yourself.  They’ll last a lifetime.

Professional knife guys use plastic handle, heavy steel knives that they can grind down every few days and replace when they’re beat.  Not cheap knives, but commercial use knives.  Think what you would use at a butcher shop, in a meat room at a grocery, at a catering place with 30 prep cooks and 100 house knives.  

What you have are artisan knives, good/required for certain professional uses that aren’t heavy volume.  If you’re doing sushi you want a knife like you have.  If you’re slicing a handful of prime meats for plating menus, you want your knives.  A chef would prefer yours.  A butcher likely wouldn’t, and they’d get beat quickly doing 8way cuts on whole chickens for 8 hours a day.

Your knife guy is wrong, you have nice knives.  High quality artisan knives.  They’re not commercial or industrial grade, which is ok. Sharpen them yourself from now on, he’ll probably take a mechanical grinder to them, not a whetstone."

WTH is this soup cause I will die if I don't have it again,"Checking for La Creperie in Lauderhill listings online I found a couple of listings for them with a bit of info about the menu that might give you a clue about the soup. 

Their webpage intro: ""Suzy and Lucien welcome you to La Crêperie! Since 1992, we have been serving traditional recipes direct from Britanny! In a cozy and friendly country French atmosphere, you will enjoy Crêpes, Quiches, and a handful of authentic French dishes. For a romantic dinner or a casual family dining.""

Their Yelp listing also has the menu for the Thursday Specials. According to that and reviews by diners they served Vichyssoise, Soupe du Jour and Soupe de Poisson. One reviewer said that the ""Soup of the day was a spice fish stew, excellent and spicy."" They also served Trout Bretonne which makes it more likely that the soup you had is their version of a classic Bretagne-style fish soup.

Take a look at this call for [Help finding recipe for Bretagne-style fish soup?] (https://www.chowhound.com/post/finding-recipe-bretagne-style-fish-soup-1029785) on Chowhound. There are lots of suggestions on how to make an authentic fish soup. 

One of the links listed on the Chowhound page is Anthony Bourdain's recipe for [Soupe de Poisson](https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/soupe-de-poisson) which instructs the cook to ""crush the heads, bones, and vegetables as much as possible, then pass that through the food mill in batches. Return to the pot along with the strained broth"" and ""serve with croutons, rouille, and some grated Parmesan on the side. The idea is to smear a little rouille on the croutons, float them in the soup as a garnish"".

And one notable comment is, ""The number one rule is: BONES. You need fish bones, therefore whole fish, that's what gives the soup its characteristic taste. Using just fish fillets will get you fish puree, nice but that's not soupe de poissons. And if you can obtain a little more taste, it's all the better, hence the trick of adding some small green crabs, shrimp or small langoustines to the broth. That is why the soup is often called ""soupe de poissons de roche"""".

"Is there a difference between coconut milk you can buy in the supermarket fridges near the regular milk, and canned coconut milk you buy near all the spices, curry pastes, etc? Tried googling the answer and I'm coming up blank!","The coconut milk used for milk substitute is usually way more dilute and feels watered down to the point where I can't really tell for sure if it has coconut in it (I grew up in a region that uses coconut milk for cooking rather heavily, so the dilute ones meant for drinking are kind of an oddity to me).

The canned coconut milk is richer and creamier, which is what normally results from pressing grated coconut flesh. There's another level to this that is coconut cream, which is even more thick.

As far as usage goes, do not cook with the drinking-grade coconut milk because it will be disappointing since it's basically white water, and it's not advisable to drink the canned coconut milk because it will be way too rich."

Why not turkey eggs?,"because they’re very, very expensive.

“Chicken hens are egg-laying dynamos, dropping one almost every day, while a turkey produces only about two per week. Chickens begin laying eggs at about five months of age, but turkeys don’t have their first cycle until more than two months later. Commercial egg producers typically, although controversially, allocate less than 50 square inches of space to a hen. Turkeys are given more than 3 square feet, enough to accommodate eight chicken hens. Turkeys also require more food than chickens. These factors combine to make turkey eggs far more expensive than chicken eggs. A dozen chicken eggs currently cost approximately $1.61. (Cage-free eggs cost twice as much.) There’s no nationwide data on the cost of turkey eggs—the USDA doesn’t even have grading regulation for turkey eggs—but many producers sell them for $2 to $3 per egg.”"

""sherbet"" (also sometimes regionally pronounced/spelled ""sherbert"") is fruit puree and whole milk.

"I have been trying to use a salt bowl after reading the salt section of Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat.

The stuff that can live in literal salt solutions are very specifically adapted to doing so, and are actually square in shape. This is because salt is incredibly good at drawing water out of cells, and the microbes themselves have to spend energy to ensure they can maintain a osmotic balance.  This is a very energy costly system to do (proton pumps are quite expensive to run for cells). Lots of the evolved pumps for this are solar powered, but are still energetically costly.

Need to make a menu sound very ladidah,"First off, I'm sorry to hear about your partner's mum. Really not an easy thing to deal with and he is a very lucky man to have someone trying so hard to cheer him up at such a shit time.

One thing we often do to make stuff sound fancier is say where it's from. Prawns become Obsiblue prawns, olive tapenade becomes Leccino olive tapenade, taramasalata becomes Loch Duart taramasalata, pandoro becomes Veronese pandoro etc. 

Another way is almost like you've done with Love Actually, describing the way it's prepared (laying it on thick how laborious and time consuming it was) and bigging up the whole free range/artisanal aspect.

You could consider going minimalist on the description and just list the ingredients like how some Michelin places do, like for La Dolce Vita i.e
'Veronese Pandoro, Curaçao triple sec, Crème Mousseline, Seville orange ganache'

Some go even more minimalist and it would literally just be:
'Pandoro, triple sec, mousseline, ganache'

How important is it to wash rice?,Depends on the variety and processing of the rice. In some countries you need to rinse basamti and other long grain rice just to clean them since they are not processed or transported free of contaminant grit. Some long-grain white rice can cook gummy if not rinsed and all rice aside from par-boiled rice is less prone to boil-over in cooking if it is rinsed. Japonica and Calrose rice for sushi sticks together better if you rinse off the excess loose starch residue from the milling/processing before cooking and true Japonica also tastes better if you soak it. It tastes less bitter and more sweet. Something to do with the starches specific to the variety. Soaking other varieties makes no taste difference that I can tell and with long grain rice it can mess up the texture.

How did this restaurant cut their carrots like this? Diagram inside.,"Ah, the ancient, sadistic French culinary tradition of tournage. The blessed craft of turning vegetables into seven sided footballs, a practice designed to torture culinary students into finger cramped insanity.  And yes, it is usually done by hand and ask any ancient French chef to do it and they will execute them perfectly without even looking at their hands while doing so. Something that brings great shame to all who witness.  I can still smell the mounds of turnips that I used to practice making into these [bastard shapes](https://imgur.com/1mhCGhT) with a bird's beak knife.

The word “tournage” comes from the French verb tourner, which means “to turn.” To tourner, or “turn,” vegetables is to cut them into faceted-oval shapes — usually with seven sides — with blunt ends. While the shape is always the same, tournage cuts have varying names depending upon their length. ""BCVCF""- Bouquetière- 3cm, Cocotte- 5cm, Vapeur- 6cm, Château- 7-ish cm and Fondante- massive. I am now having flashbacks to my culinary school finals.

These are one of the traditional taillage cuts like julienne and brunoise that are uniform in French cuisine. They are uniform for several reasons- visual appeal, the same size for even cooking and so every cook in a kitchen makes them the exact same way. 

That said, in all my years as a chef, I think I have had tourned vegetable on maybe two menus. Its more about developing knife skills and discipline.

If those carrots were done in a super traditional French way, they would have been cooked à l’étuvée. In a pan with butter, salt, water and sometimes a little sugar and then a parchment paper lid over the top so that they gently simmer and steam and develop a shiny glaze.

I need to go lay down now."

Why is washing a pan in water straight away bad while deglazing isn’t?,"Engineer here. Heat and temperature are two separate things. Temperature is what you think it is and heat is temperature times mass. When you deglaze, you have the same temperature differential as dipping the pan in a giant body of cold water, but not the same heat differential because the mass of the pan vs the tiny bit of liquid you put in it is overwhelming and the liquid just heats up quickly and the pan only cools down at a rate relatively equal and opposite the heat it takes the heat the water. When you dunk the pan in the water, the water has a comparable mass to the pan so the pan cools down at a rate that puts it at a risk for warping."

Did I Accidentally Make Edible Cheese?,"Using naturally occurring cultures is a very common way to make cheese.

Cilantro soap taste not present in certain Vietnamese sauces.,"There are two commonly used herbs that taste like cilantro, [saw tooth coriander](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eryngium_foetidum), and [Vietnamese cilantro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persicaria_odorata). Both are grown and used in south east Asian cooking, and both reportedly lack the Aldehydes that register to some as a soapy taste. Vietnamese cilantro is in fact not even from the same family as cilantro and saw toothed coriander (knotweed family vs aster family) and though its harder to get your hands on (saw toothed coriander can be found in Mexican grocers) my bet is that it's what you had. 

As an aside: I've tasted both and even tested Vietnamese cilantro on two cilantro intolerant persons. Flavorwise I prefer the Vietnamese cilantro; it's like a ever so slightly minty cilantro, whereas I've found saw tooth cilantro to have a dull flavor. And as for my tests, reactions were split, but I suspect the negative taster either strongly associated the flavor with soapyness or just simply disliked the flavor of cilantro and never suffered from the soapy taste."

3. Cook in rice cooker.
4. As soon as rice is cooked empty it into a bowl and fan it until there is no more steam.  Tamiko doesn't care if you're bored. Sit there and fan the rice.  Do you know that in Japan a young chef has to cook rice for five years before he's allowed to cook other food?"

Does anyone else put a roux in their bread dough?,"Pro chef, 20 years.  

Ok so I haven’t ever heard of this, but it makes a ton of sense.  Don’t think of it like roux.  What you’re doing is saturating some flour with butter to make it easier to disperse the butter evenly without messing up the water ratio.  This is a very clever trick and is probably a traditional variation that she learned from her grandmother who learned it from her grandmother as well.  It isn’t thickening, so don’t think of it as roux, think of it like you would think of pressing bits of cold butter into flour for a pasty crust, but the opposite - no thin flakes of butter like a croissant or puff pastry would have, more of a saturated flour that can disperse and make the bread tender.

What is the difference between marinating chicken for 30mins vs 2 hours vs 12 hours?,"Most marinades won’t penetrate chicken much past a couple hours. And most don’t actually make the chicken more tender. Some marinades even make the chicken unpleasant if left too long. On the other hand salting chicken and leaving it for 12 hours in the fridge actually tenderizes the chicken. So, for me, I look at the recipe and see what it’s doing to decide what to actually do. If it says to marinate the chicken overnight in an acidic marinade I ignore and do 2 hours. Maybe I’ll have dry brined it the night before with just salt. If the same marinade is being used to prepare the chicken when you cook it, that’s where all the flavor is coming from. So I ignore lots of recipes that call for long marinades. At the same time, I do think there’s a difference between a half hour and say an hour and a half, if the chicken wasn’t brined already."
Are boiling potatoes before roasting them neccesary?,"The main benefit to boiling before roasting in my opinion  is a crispier, craggier exterior on your finished potatoes. Boiling them creates additional texture on the outsides as they soften slightly, which then crisps in the oven.

Is there a difference in “Heavy Cream” and “Heavy Whipping Cream” if they are both labeled 36% milk fat?,"They are interchangeable, but read the rest of the label.

In the US, a lot of heavy creams have stabilizers like gellan gum, and the vast majority are UHT pasteurized.

The former will slightly impact baking characteristics and make whipping / emulsification easier, and the latter will impact setting characteristics in cheese, relative to 'normal' pasteurized or raw cream with its enzymes intact.  I don't think either change is completely prohibitive for most recipes, but they might need adjustment.

I wouldn't try making your own brie with UHT cream, but clotted cream worked fine for me, contrary to what a lot of articles say."
"When people fuck up the first pancake, are they not letting the batter sit long enough, or are they not heating their pan long enough, or something else?","it's a combination of heat and fat. Most pancake batter has melted butter or some other fat in it, which means it only needs enough fat in the pan to not stick.

Where people go wrong is they put too much butter on the griddle/in the pan, and you end up frying the first pancake rather than just cooking it. Furthermore, you need to rest the batter. This does two things: hydrates the flour and activates the chemical leavener. Both of those are chemical changes (starches and proteins do stuff in water), and both allow your pancakes to rise.

So combining unrested batter with too much fat in a too-hot pan results in a skinny, dense, greasy, gummy, burnt mess."

From that bechamel you can make a myriad of other sauces, but just focusing on mac'n''cheese, now you can sub other cheeses than the recipe just quickly reading up on which melt well. 

When you make a good mac, you only partially cook the pasta ahead of time, and finish cooking it in the sauce. Well hey, that's true for almost any pasta dish, so next time you make spaghetti, you know to not overcook the pasta.

If so, I would make the soup by starting with 8 oz of chicken stock in the pot, adding the creamed corn, adding the chicken (and heating till it is cooked if the chicken was raw to start). Dissolve the cornstarch in a few tablespoons of cold water and mix into the pot, stirring to distribute evenly till the soup has thickened. Beat raw eggs till “scrambled”, and pour it into the soup in a thin stream whilst stirring to also distribute evenly and form the egg wisps. Finish with the seasonings. Order of seasonings probably don’t matter. And yes probably the broth/stock words used are interchangeable."

"We are John Becker and Megan Scott, co-authors of the 2019 edition of the Joy of Cooking. Ask us anything about the book or about cooking and food in general! We will also accept Thanksgiving-related questions :)","Hello! To the person who posted the first question (""what types of recipes needed the most revising?""), not sure what happened, but here's our answer:

It's hard to generalize with regard to recipe type. In general, the more complicated a recipe, the more motivated we were to update and improve it... Cassoulet and Seafood and Sausage Paella come to mind. We did not try to ""dumb them down,"" but the way they had been written in previous editions made them more complicated and inflexible than they needed to be.

We were also making more broad changes to different sections of the book. For instance, in the Vegetables chapter, we wanted to respond to the way people are cooking vegetables now. Back in the 70s (and before), folks were cooking vegetables to death. Then in the 80s and 90s there was a backlash, and ""crisp-tender"" became very popular. Now folks are kind of swinging back to the middle of the spectrum, acknowledging that, depending on the vegetable, they can be excellent crisp-tender or cooked beyond that.

Then there was the cake chapter. A lot of the older layer cake recipes had you separate the eggs, then beat the whites and fold them into the batter. We did a bunch of side-by-side tests on these cakes to see if whipping the egg whites was necessary. We found that the difference was minimal and that we preferred the cakes with whole eggs rather than separated ones. We think this is a preference that has changed over time: folks used to prefer lighter cakes, and now we like them a little richer."

Edit: you could have coffee soup. But you have to present it as soup- ie served in a bowl with a ladle style spoon."
"I have EDS, a mandolin slicer, and zero adult supervision (yes I'm 26) -- need help finding a cut resistant glove/food gripper","Hi! I have hEDS too, and though my grip strength is alright I can still empathize with clumsy and awkward and stupid fragile skin.

Your basic [cut resistant gloves](https://nocry.com/products/nocry-microdot-cut-resistant-gloves) are a spandex-fibreglass-polyethylene weave. I've seen them in discount stores, so they're fairly affordable. They feel like a knit fabric, are flexible and grip quite well, and will protect you most of the time. You'll find that the mandoline will cut small slices in the fingertips of the gloves PARTICULARLY if the glove is too large for you, and they need to be washed (you can throw them in with your laundry) after using.

A slightly tougher option is the same glove but with a [polyurethane coating](https://www.werko.com.au/product/stealth-razor-cut-5-resistant-gloves) on the palm and fingertips. They feel a little stiffer, which could be difficult if grip strength is an issue, but the PU coating has more friction than the knit fabric of the first option so it's a trade off there. This style will last a bit longer before the cuts in the fingertips build up, but take a while to dry after washing so if you want to use them every day you may need more than one.

My personal favourite is an actual [steel mesh glove](https://www.amazon.com.au/Resistant-Stainless-Butcher-Cutting-Chopping/dp/B07FP5HYLH/ref=asc_df_B07FP5HYLH)! Not quite chain mail but it's tough, super easy to wash without starting a load of laundry, dries quickly and doesn't get stained or soggy the way knit gloves do. The downside is that they're a bit slipperier and you're supposed to wear a thin cotton glove inside them, though of course you can skip that. If planning to wear one without the cotton glove, go a size down.

Another suggestion just in general is to wrap a bandaid or a thin piece of strapping tape over the tip of the fingers on your slicing hand before putting the glove on. Mostly it's the first joint of your finger that's in danger with a mandoline. (EDIT: you can do strapping tape over your palm too, if slicing flat-handed.) It doesn't have any noticeable effect on grip strength, the bandaid can't fall into the food through the glove, and you get an extra layer of protection in case the blade gets through the glove. There are other options like [steel finger guards](https://au.grandado.com/products/4pcs-set-adjustable-stainless-steel-finger-hand-guard-finger-protector-knife-slice-chop-safe-slice-cooking-tools) but I really want my whole hand covered i.e. a glove when operating a mandoline.

All links are examples only, not purchase recommendations as I don't know where you live/what size hands you have/etc. Happy to help narrow it down to a specific affordable option once you know what you're looking for."
What are some often-forgotten kitchen rules to teach to children who are learning to cook?,Water doesn't put out a grease fire!
Can’t eat immediately after cooking — common problem?,"Two things :

* Cooking is often hot, occasionally stressful work (especially if it's something ""nice"" for guests). This can definitely suppress your appetite. Try dishes that you can mostly prepare ahead of time and might only require a brief assembly or reheating before eating.

* You can get taste fatigue. Smelling, essentially, is tasting. You are smelling the food constantly as you cook. By the time it is done, you might be tired of it! Have you ever had someone walk into the kitchen and remark ""wow, that smells great!"" but you don't really smell a thing? That's exactly why. Being able to walk away from a meal before serving it, even for a few minutes, can make a big difference. Again, plan ahead so you don't need to constantly be in the kitchen right before the meal. Maybe ask someone else to stir something for a minute while you go set the table, or make something you can keep warm in the oven for a few minutes while you walk away before serving. (On a side note, this is why sandwiches actually do taste better when someone else makes them for you.)"
Why don't my waffles taste nearly as good as waffle houses'?,"The oil they use and the butter at Waffle House can be the difference in flavor. Also as another person suggested, try adding a little vanilla."

"Is there a job where you just create recipes for a restaurant, but not cook them? If so, what is it called?","There is such a thing as a recipe creator.

You can read about it here: https://www.escoffier.edu/blog/culinary-arts/alternative-culinary-careers-recipe-developer/"
"Just for kicks, I tried cooking my eggs over easy in heavy cream instead of butter. They had too much traction in the pan so I couldn't really flip them. The final product seemed pretty much the same as with butter. So, is cooking eggs in cream even a thing, and if so what are the applications?","I remembered reading this a while back, seems like you're on to something! https://food52.com/blog/24627-why-ideas-in-food-eggs-are-genius"
Keeping hands and cooking utensils clean while cooking,"There are a few techniques. First, they probably wash their hands more than they show on camera. Proper hand washing is a cornerstone of safe food preparation.

Second, one of the best ways to minimize the need for handwashing is to work in order from your ""least dangerous"" foods to your ""most dangerous"" ones. That means you start by prepping all your produce that's fine to eat raw before you start prepping your meats. And if you have multiple meats that you need to touch, you go in order of ascending final temperature (e.g. handle a steak or a piece of fish before you handle a chicken breast). You can still wash your hands between ingredients, but it's more for comfort and convenience than safety if you can stick to this pattern (sometimes it's inconvenient to do this way though, depending on the recipe).

NOTE: If everything is going to be cooked to a safe temperature, it's not all that important to avoid cross-contamination between different ingredients. But it's still a good habit to get into nonetheless.

Third, specifically around salt, most chefs are using loose salt rather than salt in a grinder. It happens to usually be Diamond Crystal Kosher salt, but any salt will do once you learn how much to use. With loose salt, you can easily pour some into a container to use for your recipe, and then discard what's leftover (or add the salt back into your container, since nothing will really grow on the salt itself). There is no benefit to ""freshly ground"" salt, since it doen't lose flavor over time after grinding.

Since pepper is best ground fresh (as are other spices), the most hygenic compromise between flavor and convenience is to grind a bunch of pepper (or the amount of a spice that you need) before you start cooking, and if you have any leftover after cooking discard what's left. That way you don't have to handle the grinder with dirty hands, but still have fresh pepper. And again, you want to try to season things in order from least to most dangerous. You don't want to touch chicken, then touch your pepper, then use that same pepper to season a salad."
"Chineses dumplings - ""stir the meat in one direction"" - food science question - what is happening when you stir the meat in one direction?","The stirring in one direction is an old wives' tale/tradition to remind people to stir the mixture thoroughly in order to develop the correct texture. 

The science of it is that the action of manipulating the meat has real results. The mechanical process creates a sticky, cohesive filling. Its the difference between barely shoving meat together for the tender texture of a meatball vs. the other end of the spectrum, grinding meat for a snappy sausage. Mechanically working it starts to break down the protein structure, including one of the two major contracting filaments, the protein myosin, while squeezing out the trapped water. Myosin begins to coagulate at the relatively low temperature of 120ºF/50ºC which then leads to a more solid and firm texture in the end product. 

End result= dumplings work better with a stickier, developed filling."

Is mixing spices before putting them on the food better than just sprinkling them one by one?,"As an Indian, I think I can add a little bit or a lot of depth to the discussion. We treat spices very differently compared to most cuisines. First of all, know what you want to do with the spices and what you want them to do for you. Same spice can give you very different flavours depending on how you treat it. For example, coriander seeds, toasted and ground, when added to fat and cooked at low temperature will impart an earthiness but smoke it high and it'll give you a smoky flavor. Toast it and cook it whole and you'll get a slightly different aroma with texture. And so on and so forth. Another example is fennel seeds. Toast it, grind it and add in a sauce on top. It'll give you a sweet cool aromatic finish on the palate. Compare that to fennel powder that is crushed without toasting. The sweetness of latter is more natural and not that concentrated. Compare still to fennel powder added during cooking process in a dish like roghan josh. The flavor is more complicated and hard. Similarly, prosciutto uses fennel powder at times as far as I'm aware but curing makes it taste very different. So on and so forth. 


So to sum it up, you've to learn to cook with spices. Figure out which ones you like the most and figure out which profiles you want to emphasize while cooking certain foods. That'll help you understand different stages at which you can add spices. To give you an idea, here are different ways to add spices to your food. 

1. Toast them, grind to a mix - you can use this mix as a seasoning or a rub for marinade. 

2. Add powdered or whole spices (procured from stores) to sauces with fat, sauté them to release aroma and cook sauce to finish. Examples include cloves, bay leaf, cilantro seeds etc.

3. Add spices before finishing to infuse the sauce with aromatics. Good example is saffron. Another is nutmeg or mace. Cooked too long, these spices will lose aroma. Cooked too little they can be too strong to be palatable. 

4. Add spices as finish. Examples include cumin powder, saffron (used correctly), cardamom, cinnamon etc.

There's a lot more to be said about spices. For example, grinding (in grinder) versus pulverising (in mortar pestle) and other minor considerations that become very prominent in traditional cuisines that use spices heavily.

Why did making hot chocolate clean off the brown stains in my stainless steel pot?,Cocoa powder is apparently acidic so that is what did it.

A Cilantro Substitute Made By People Who Like Cilantro?,"My wife has the soap-gene and she says she can't taste the soapy-ness (and really enjoys what she can taste) when she has vinegar pickled cilantro. \[We found out because a farmer's market vendor was handing out samples of different naan-spreads and one of them was topped with a vinegar-y cilantro 'pesto' and to all of our surprise my wife loved it\]  


So maybe you can 'deactivate' the soap by soaking chopping cilantro in vinegar and then use that soaked cilantro in dishes where some extra acid wouldnt be bad?"
Is adding vinegar to milk a good substitute for buttermilk?,"So I live somewhere (China) where buttermilk just plain isn't available. I've cycled through a lot of options - vinegar included - and my suggested substitute is yoghurt.

In an ideal world, first thing in the morning I take milk (for me, buffalo milk actually... it's local and can be delivered to my door, bog standard cow milk is also good though), toss a couple tablespoons of yoghurt in it, shake it up and leave it on the counter (I live in a subtropical climate, wherever in your house is warm is good). By the time I cook in the afternoon or in the evening, it's good to go and works quite well as a buttermilk sub. Or if you're making pancakes, you can do it at night and come to it in the morning.

As an aside, if you use cream (even UHT cream) and do the same thing for a full 24 hours, together with a tiny splash of vinegar to taste you can make a very convincing sour cream substitute. 

If you don't feel like going through that whole song and dance, you can also just use yoghurt straight up, though note that it'll have a bit more of that yoghurt-y tang to it. Usually still quite tasty, but would be a touch different of a flavor than the recipe writer was envisioning. 

[Stella Parks has a good writeup over on SE about some different choices](https://www.seriouseats.com/2017/04/how-to-substitute-buttermilk.html), apparently her sub of choice was kefir. For me however, in order to get kefir I've gotta make it myself with the grains and all, which I just can't be bothered with."

So when you ordered your ramen, your noodles went into the water of the...noodle cooker, which is basically a big boiling water bath with baskets in it. whatever hot toppings you ask for go on the teppan grill. 3 minutes later, noodles come out, into the bowl, broth of choice goes over the top, then garnish with whatever you ordered."
"Is it possible to cook cranberries down in a way that results in a glaze-like syrup I could drizzle on a salad?

Why are green peppers or toppings other than onions generally not considered normal to put on a Philly Cheesesteak?,"Some people are overly concerned with finding the 'most authentic' and original version of a foodstuff, then deifying it and gatekeeping other people's enjoyment of it. No food is authentic, everything has developed through cross pollination and evolution of tastes.

What does adding eggs one at a time do?,"I used to have to make a batch of eclairs once a week at work. You boil the water, add the salt and butter, melt, stir in the flour, move it to a mixing bowl, add eggs slowly, then form, and bake. Easy.

After I put in my 2 week notice I was showing someone else how to do the recipe. I explained that it's super simple, but finicky, so don't mess with the recipe or the method.

So we get to the adding eggs one at a time stage. We have 64 eggs shelled and in a pitcher. She adds the first egg, no problem. 5 seconds later, she adds the second egg, no problem. Then she tipped the pitcher and poured in half the eggs, so about 30 or so all at once.

The batter didn't have a chance to incorporate them, and became slippery. The blade for the paddle would slice through, followed by the raw egg, which would coat the strip of batter it just made with eggs, over and over again. After a few minutes of trying to get it to mix in, it looked like fat spaghetti noodles in a bowl of clearish gelatin. It did eventually mix in, but it took forever. And that batch of eclairs just didn't have the right mouth feel."
Upgrading Soy Sauce,"[Yamashin Shiro Shoyu](https://www.souschef.co.uk/products/white-soy-sauce-yamashin-shiro-shoyu) white soy is my crack.

Why do some people recommend to heat the empty pan before adding any fat ?,"It depends. For lower heats, it really doesn’t matter. However, if you’re at a higher heat, there is a good reason to add the fat in after the pan is heated: smoking. 

If you put the fat in a cold pan and heat it up to a high temp, there will be a long period of time when the fat passes it’s smoke point but the pan isn’t up to the desired temp yet. That whole time, the oil is releasing smoke in your kitchen. 

Alternatively, if you heat the pan to the desired temp and then add the fat, there might still be a period when it smokes. This time, however, it’s only the few seconds it takes you to put in the thing you’re cooking. And if you’re quick enough, you can even avoid that.

For example, when I stir fry, I first heat my wok up as high as it will go. Then, add some oil, swirl it around, and as soon as it starts shimmering toss in whatever I’m stir frying.

All this is dependent on the heat you’re turning the pan up to and the smoke point of the fat you’re using."
My prime rib “expires” on December 21st. Will it still be ok on Christmas? Should I follow a dry aging or dry brine process?,"That’s a “sell by” date, not an expiration date. Big difference.

What's the name of the white garlic sauce in Mediterranean bowls?,"It is indeed toum, but a lot of places use mayo or greek yoghurt to make it which gives it a completely different texture and taste.

Do you cut off the hard bit on garlic cloves?,"Yeah,  makes peeling the clove much easier."
Why is it easier for a Japanese restaurant to get a 4.5+ star rating than a Thai place?,"Online reviews such as from Google and Yelp have lots of variability.  A lot of Asian restaurants in general have very swingy reviews because people with and without an understanding of the cultures will read things very differently.  For example, many great ""hole in the wall"" places get bad reviews from non-Asian eaters because of ""bad service"" - when the service is excellent... for Asian food values.  Deliver food when it's ready, piping hot, and clear away dirty dishes, bringing the check quickly - these are signs of efficient and great service at many Asian restaurants, but they can be off-putting to people accustomed to European dining, where you bring all plates out at once, course the meal, and let diners take their time before clearing the table or bringing the bill. 

There is also a lot of hype around Japanese food - especially Americanized sushi (mayo, massive rolls, lots of fried ingredients and spicy sauces) - so many restaurants (smartly) focus on presentation, which gets higher reviews from people who are looking for an experience, rather than an appreciation of traditional, quality Japanese food, which would seem bland and unexciting to many used to nontraditional versions.   

I always look at who is reviewing (what kinds of places they tend to like) and what they're saying about the place before weighting what they say.  I also check the menu to see what is being served - is it really Americanized, does it look like it appeals to the party crowd?  - to give context to what kind of place it is. 

Because of all these factors, it really won't make sense to compare ethnicity of restaurants and the reviews they get - different types of people go to these places, and the people rating have very diverse standards for what they're looking for."

Can I cook creme brulee in a large oven dish for just one time?,"You can totally do this. I think the biggest hurdle will be making sure the middle is set without overcooking the sides.

"Why is yeast an ingredient in flat foods (ex: Saltine Crackers, waffer cookies, BBQ potato chips)? I thought yeast was just used to make food fluffy.",This is for taste.

What’s the best alternative to parchment paper for making cookies?,"Whatever you do, NOT wax paper. It will burn"
Why should I heat up the pan 1st and then add oil?,"A few reasons:

1. Helps prevent burning your oil if you leave it on the heat.  The pan is hot, you put in the oil and pretty much immediately follow with food.  The food cools the oil and as it cooks and releases water content it regulates the oil's temperature.  If you leave oil alone in a pan as it's heating it's way easier to accidentally leave it and have it start smoking and polymerizing
2. Metal is porous and sometimes in certain types of pans (definitely happens in scratched up stainless steel pans sometimes) there can be moisture essentially trapped in the metal.  If you get the pan hot it will force that moisture to evaporate, but if instead there's a layer of fat on top of it, when it finally does get hot enough it can essentially ""explode"" (at a small scale) and splatter oil
3. If you are going for a really hard sear, such as with a steak, you can get the pan way hotter than you can get oil (or you want to get oil).  Example: Let's say you are searing a steak in a cast iron, which can hold a lot of heat energy.  You get the cast iron to say around 600F.  Add a touch of oil and immediately put the steak in.  The steak cools the pan but all that extra heat the pan had by being at 600 is going to make it so that it won't cool *too much* and will still be at searing temperatures of \~400F ideally.  However, if you had started with a cold pan with oil in it, by the time the pan gets to 400F the oil is at 400F and the oil starts smoking (depending on its smoke point and what kind of oil you're using).  This means you can't get the pan up to 600F because the oil will just be smoking itself to smithereens and will taste awful (and probably set off your fire alarm).  In this scenario it is better if your pan is somewhat over-preheated before you add the oil (be careful though, if your pan is significantly above the flash point of the oil you are using the oil could immediately ignite upon contact with the pan -- I have both seen others do this and done it myself in restaurants I've worked in when I left a pan on the french top too long before putting oil in it)"
Why does the taste of sesame oil overpower dishes when I cook at home vs ordering from a restaurant?,"There are 2 kinds of sesame oil - regular and toasted. 

Regular is light-colored (like canola or vegetable oil), has a pretty neutral flavor, and is commonly used as a cooking oil.

Toasted is dark brown, has a strong flavor, and is generally used in very small amounts as a finishing flavor.

My guess is you’re using toasted sesame oil as a cooking oil which means you’d have to be using too much."

"Boiled stock for risotto, dipped ladle and IT EXPLODED.","When materials undergo a phase change, the points at which the molecules go from one phase to another happen at ""nucleation points."" They're the points where it takes the least amount of energy to change phases, often pointed bits on the surfaces of the container. For example, beer glasses and champagne flutes are sometimes laser etched so the bubbles will form on the etching, instead of the sides of the glass.

When your stock was boiling vigorously, there was a ton of excess energy in the liquid, so really, any nucleation sites will work, not just the ones on the bottom of the pot where the heat source is. 

You added the ladle, which has a bunch of nucleation sites. This caused a chaotic chain reaction that would have settled down after a few seconds, even if you didn't turn down the heat.

Mom wants a cheesy Mexican rice she had at Taco Viva. Some chain place 40 years ago,"So there is a [Taco Viva history page](https://www.tacoviva.com/index.html) and it even has a copy of the [menu](https://www.tacoviva.com/images/TVmenu87.pdf). Looking at that, the only rice is just a generic Mexican rice cooked with a sofrito base, and there was probably a little cheese mixed in.

Now, there are a lot of recipes for this kind of thing. Some of them are just, like, [rice with salsa and cheese mixed in](https://www.food.com/recipe/10-minute-cheesy-mexican-rice-132955), which is probably heresy to anyone who had an abuela that made Spanish rice from scratch. But it might be an accurate approximation of a side dish from a Florida fast food chain in the 80s.

If, instead, you want to make a home-cooking version from scratch, [here is a recipe you could follow](https://jamiecooksitup.net/2013/01/cheesy-spanish-rice/)."
What is the exact process by which a steak is cooked at an expensive steak house?,"The place I work at has an $85, 25 oz ribeye. Sear on both sides in a carbon steel pan with tallow. Drain. Add butter, garlic, aromatics, etc.. baste, baste, baste.. flip, baste again some more.. Stick in 450 oven for about 10-12 min for mid rare.. and you’re done."
"Whereas chicken nuggets are a mainstay of many fast food locations, why have I never even heard of ""beef nuggets"" made anywhere?","Check out Bitterballen. It’s Dutch bar food that is essentially beef stew balls that are deep fried. It is ridiculously good, and I have no idea why I haven’t found it elsewhere."
"Many recipes recommend hand crushed canned tomatoes, but I've also heard that pre crushed canned tomatoes are actually picked riper because they don't need to maintain their shape at all. If this is true, why do most recipes avoid them?","At work we use whole plum tomatoes from the can, 16 cases at a time. My best explanation for it is that we are better able to control the texture of the final marinara we're making. Once the kettle comes up to a simmer and we have it seasoned etc it only cooks for about 2 hours and the whole tomatoes break down to the consistency we like."

Why is it safe to eat raw eggs in mayo or eggnog. But not on other things?,"1- The risk of Salmonella from raw eggs is extremely low, especially when combined with other antibiotic conditions (acidic mayos, alcoholic eggnogs, etc). 

2- Raw cookie dough contains raw flour, which is considered on average to be more dangerous than raw eggs since there have been numerous e. Coli and Salmonella outbreaks related to raw flour. 

TL;DR raw flour is the issue not raw eggs."
I’m surrendering - simple dish has vexed me for YEARS. Chicken over potatoes,"So the ""broken down chicken on top"" may be a clue - if your host roasted the potatoes with the chicken on top (as I do) those spuds were roasting in chicken fat that dripped down on them, and that's how they tasted so good. I suspect your error is in thinking they're a different dish from the chicken.

Personally when I roast a chicken I do it on a bed of root vegetables (usually potatoes and carrots) in a cast iron skillet and they come out amazing from the fat they're cooking in."

Anytime I cook garlic in oil over medium heat it burns instantly. How come recipes keep telling me to do this?,"You're cooking it over high heat. You think it's medium, perhaps because it says ""medium"" on the knob. But your stove's knobs don't mean anything. Nobody's knobs mean anything. They might as well be written in Egyptian hieroglyphs."
"Has anyone noticed that crushing garlic into a paste in a mortar and pestle, vs mincing/grating it, it becomes incredibly mild and sweet to the point of being usable as a spread? Is this a known thing or just in my head? Are there uses of an M&P like this for other ingredients?","Serious Eats did an article comparing techniques of mincing garlic and how the flavor varies:  ""The more cell damage that occurs, the more allicin is produced, and the stinkier the garlic becomes, which is why a single clove can have such varying impact on a dish depending on its form.""

[The Best Way to Mince Garlic](https://www.seriouseats.com/2015/01/how-to-mince-chop-garlic-microplane-vs-garlic-press.html)"
How to peel a LARGE amount of garlic,"Here’s how we do it in prep kitchens:

Smash all the heads into individual cloves and put them in a container that will also hold water. 

Go to your kitchen sink and turn on the hot water. Let it run until it gets too hot to put your hands under, like a full minute or two, and then cover the unpeeled cloves in hot water and put it on the countertop.

Let it sit until the water is at room temperature, then go ahead and drain the container. The cloves will now be easy to peel.

I typically take a small paring knife and cut off the ugly bit at the root, cutting through the clove but not through the “back” side of the skin. Then, in one motion, you can grab the skin between the knife and your thumb and peel it all off. 

I can get through a case of garlic with this method in about 25 minutes. Also, your hands will smell like garlic for about 4 days. 

Best of luck."
Accidently added 2 sticks of butter to a cake recipe. It came out pretty good. Why wasn't it ruined?,"People are saying “butter is good” and that’s absolutely true but I think the reason the cake came out fine (though I’m assuming a little oily) is because more butter = denser cake, not ruined cake. Brownies have a lot of fat and so does pound cake. Sponge cake has very little fat.

Obviously there are other factors contributing to this (literally all the other ingredients), but I would hazard a guess that it’s mostly just the density that changes."

Why the hell can't I sharpen my knife?,Hit the edge on each side with a layer of sharpie and then try again. That will help you know where you're making contact between the blade and the stone.

Starting culinary school in my 30’s,"If you have never worked in a restaurant, go do that before you commit to culinary school and this as a career. Cooking at home bears no resemblance to cooking professionally. The hours are long, the money sucks, you'll be away from family on holidays, its massively male dominated, line cooking will make 35 feel like 75 as you compete against 18 year olds who live on energy drinks and nicotine and this world wide plague has utterly crushed the industry.

Culinary school doesn't really get you a leg up other than to make contacts with instructors and fellow students. Cordon Bleu's outside of Paris are all franchises. Never met a CB grad nor seen it on a resume in either the US or the UK. 

Go check out r/kitchenconfidential where the pros gather for a feel for the industry and there are a few archived posts about culinary school and starting out in the industry in the sidebar."

is it normal that my beef stock is a jellylike consistency?,Yes. Gelatinous stock is good stock
Why is butter deemed healthier than margarine even though it contains a lot of saturated fats?,"It's a rebound from the great lipid scare of the 70s and 80s.

I can do pages on this.  But in short cardiac problems use to be linked to dietary intake of saturated fats and cholesterol.  People moved to margarine which for manufacturing reasons contained a lot of trans fats.  And it was cheaper, and the government was pushing it.  I will try to avoid discussing how much politics played in all of this.

In short, turns out ratios of short chain, medium chain and long chain triglycerides is more important.  Butter ain't bad in that category."
Do you reuse oil after deep frying ?,"Yes, for future deep frying. Strain out any bits that get left in it and store in a sealed container. You should be able to get several uses out of it.

"Why are ""econmical cuts"" of beef more expensive than ""expensive cuts""?","Rising demand, probably in no small part because everyone has been bigging them up as “cheap cuts” for years.

Same thing has happened with ox tail"
Slow cooker food tastes bland or just blah. What am I doing wrong?,"Slow cooking herbs for 5 hours will greatly affect the flavor (it will be much milder the longer you cook them).

"What does washing rice actually *do*, and when to apply/not apply?","There is no one hard and fast rule or reasoning for any or all rice- different varieties, different applications, different cultures all impact if rice gets washed/aka rinsed/soaked/tossed into a pot as is, etc.

* Where the rice is from and how it is stored may dictate that it gets washed to remove detritus of the packaging or storage process, remove dirt or other impurities, etc., not just starch. My Singaporean step mother kept the rice in a garbage bag in a huge bucket in the garage. That shit got rinsed.

* If the end result desired is rice that does not clump it gets rinsed- often sushi, jasmine, etc. One of the biggest complaints is people getting mushy results from a high end rice cooker and when you drill down, you find out they don't rinse their rice. [Watch a YT of an expert sushi rice maker](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hsBHBMrm-wg&si=EnSIkaIECMiOmarE) and you'll see that sushi rice ain't no joke.

* Method of cooking can also impact if it gets washed or soaked. A lot of dishes that use basmati call for soaking the rice. I am sure someone more knowledgeable when it comes to basmati will come thundering out of the bush to add to this.

* For congee or risotto, two very different types of rice but both starchy applications, do not get washed [unless impurities are a concern.]  Starch release is a big part of what makes both wonderfully creamy.

* Having grown up around the world, culture plays a big part in how we deal with food [see also every damn post about washing chicken] but Asian cultures tend to wash/soak, etc. their rice more than people who grew up in families that eat rice once in a blue moon. I first ate rice in Texas where it was served wet, with a pat of margarine and no salt. My mother could rock out tamales but rice? The rice gods should have struck her down."
I tried pork intestine and all I tasted was poop...is that normal??,yip. It needs to be rinsed under cold water for AGES to remove most of that smell/taste.
What do you do with soup you intend to eat across 3 days? Why?,"I just transfer it to 1 or 2 large Tupperware containers. When I want to eat it, I use a ladle or dishing spoon to scoop out the amount I want and put it in a microwave safe bowl. You could also just leave it in the pot, but make sure to dish out and heat up only the portion you plan on eating. It’s bad to heat and cool food multiple times. Just like it’s bad to freeze and thaw food repeatedly."
Why would anyone use a grill rather than a flat top?,"Grills provide multiple types of heat- direct heat from the metal, radiant heat from the coals, with the lid down, you also get convection heat. The fat dripping down onto coals creates additional flavour compounds that are then absorbed into the meat. You can add different varieties of wood to create additional flavour profiles. The smoke from the interaction also creates flavour.

Flat tops only apply direct heat from one side, let the meat wallow in its own fat, don't create any additional flavour from the interaction of the fat with the coal, you can't add wood for additional variety or add flavour from smoke.

I have both a flat top and a grill where I work. We cook 100% of steaks and burgers on the grill and use the flat top to toast buns, make omelettes and hot hold sauces. And thats only because I don't have enough burners to spare for the omelettes."
Why aren't there more spices?,"There's  [lots of spices and spice blends](https://foodal.com/knowledge/herbs-spices/guide-reference/).

How does one make fried mushrooms that are more crispy and firm?,"When you first start cooking them, add water rather than oil (seriously, I know it sounds dumb but it helps with flavor). Add some salt. Then, cook them. TONS of water will come out. Your mushrooms will be swimming. Keep cooking.

Once most of the water evaporates, add a bit of oil and taste for seasoning. Keep cooking until they brown. You can burn them, but otherwise basically cannot overcook them (they’ll never get mushy from too much cooking)."
I caramelized four pounds of onions down to a spread. Could I freeze it in cubes for longer storage?,"Short answer, yes.

Long answer, when the cubes are frozen pop them out and seal them in a ziptop bag or similar to reduce the exposure to air in the freezer."
What foods should I not freeze?,"Any watery fruits and vegetables don’t freeze well, like cucumber, watermelon etc. Because of their high water content, freezing them changes their structure significantly and affects the taste/texture when thawed. You’re basically breaking apart the structure when you freeze them and then expect them to go back to the original structure when you thaw them out again. If you’re using some things like frozen strawberries frozen, like in a smoothie, it should be fine."
What's the name of the really crunchy fries you typically get hole in the wall spots? How are they made to be like that?,I'm a chef and I buy these for my kitchen.

I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask but why do I only see raw walnuts in stores? Why are all other nuts available roasted and salted except walnuts?,"Toasted nuts actually go rancid faster than raw nuts. Walnuts go rancid faster than other nuts because they have the highest polyunsaturated fat content by almost double or triple other commonly sold nuts. So roasting them compounds the speed of them going rancid. You can find them roasted/salted but they’re much rarer to find than like say, peanuts or almonds."

"When I was in 5th grade I developed an intrest in cooking and told everyone I was gonna be a chef. Fast forward into my twenties, I persued a major in psychology and midway, I am realizing that cooking may have been my real passion. My question is what do I need to become a decent self taught chef?","Just so you're aware of what being a professional chef is like.
I recently met with a chef that's been in the industry for 40+ years and what he said really changed my mind on becoming a chef.

Expect to work 18 hour days when things get hectic.

Weekends no longer exist.

If you're really lucky you'll get 2 days off per week, otherwise it'll be 1.

Your social life is in the kitchen.

If you get married it's almost always to someone who works alongside you because you often do not have the free time to date outside your direct industry.

""At the end of your 3 years study you will not be a chef, you are on the bottom rung until you can prove yourself, and that takes time. You are unlikely to be ready to be a competent head chef in your first 7 years in the industry, your qualification doesn't get you a ticket to the top, it just means you can cook"".

The kitchen always comes first.

Your lower back and feet take tremendous strain. Fuck either up and you're out of the job.

The pay is shit. Expect minimum wage until you've proven yourself. And once you've proven yourself don't expect anything fancy until you reach the top.

Get used to stress.

You will have to interact with customers, take their shit, and their compliments. You must remain composed throughout.

This isn't to scare you from the industry, it's just to lay bare what the ""norm"" can be like when working in a restaurant etc.
Obviously like all industries there are awesome gigs that have great hours etc, strive for that, but don't expect it.

Obviously none of this really applies if you just want to be good at cooking and maybe do something like a catering business/YT channel."
My cooking profesor said my dish was too flat.,"Take the potato out of the salad. 
Make a nice warm potato salad with leeks, put a round down and smash the potato salad into it to make a nice circle, place your meat on that, drizzle the sauce around.

Flour Moths,"Oh, please don't get used to it. They don't just live in flour, they live in chocolate and nuts and all kinds of things. They form webs and have little maggots and are NOT normal. 

Throw away anything contaminated, seal everything not visibly contaminated, clean everything, and watch for new moths so you can repeat if needed."
Is there a secret to peeling the first papery layer of an onion?,You’re fine and not alone.  Just go straight to peeling that extra layer off.  Onions are cheap enough it’s not worth the hassle to get it exact.  Also sometimes that extra layer is kinda dried out anyway.
Why does Greek yogurt start becoming watery only after you open it? Is there any way to prevent it?,"Hey, I'm greek and eat a tub every day. I just make sure that the yogurt lays flat and has no craters and never get any water leaking. Everyone else has some scientific knowledge of it that seems to disagree with me but honestly I just take the spoon I used and flatten it out and that completely prevents the leakage.

Edit: another thing I do that I just noticed when I was eating yogurt is after I flatten it I shake the tub lightly side to side without lifting it off the table and it flattens the spoon marks."
"How to Deal with the general workings of a large wooden cutting board, and how to clean as you go","I have 2-3 towels at a time in the kitchen and probably 20 in my linen closet. 1 for drying clean dishes, and the others for wiping my hands, cutting board, etc. As it gets dirty, I’ll swap it for a new one if needed.

-add 10-15% more salt than you would at ground level
-don’t have eggs
-vinegar, lemon and lime are your best friends. 
-use a slice of butter on top of any meat or vegetables you’re going to reheat, it should melt over and keep everything moist"

How do I serve fresh pasta to big groups?,"You can hold fresh pasta for a few hours at room temp, or fridge it if you are really concerned. Otherwise, it really depends on which particular dish you are serving. You can make lasagna a day in advance, stuffed fresh pasta/dumplings freezes and cooks from frozen beautifully, and otherwise, just make a giant batch, nest, dust, and fridge if you are worried about it sitting out too long."
What's the difference between using lime (green colored) and lemon (yellow colored) in my food?,"Food science answer: They have very extensive volatile flavor differences. Both contain relatively the same concentration of citric acid in their juice, so there won't be much of an acidity difference. It comes down to the flavor that each brings. Lemons contain higher concentrations of ""light"" and ""candylike"" flavor compounds (aldehydes like citral and terpenes like pinene) which is why they are used more often to ""lift"" or "" brighten"" dishes, where lime has many more ""heavy"" and ""floral"" flavor compounds (like fenchyl alcohol and terpineol) that can complement and cut through many strong flavor profiles. Cuisine plays a huge part to be sure, but both play different roles in adding acidity to various dishes."
"Who uses curly parsley, when flat-leafed is as available, and why?","As a chef, I can tell you curly parsley is 1000% easier to finely chop"
Does pure vanilla bean taste good?,"I’ve done this myself with a small amount of vanilla bean last time I was using it. It tastes like bland vanilla. Less bitter than vanilla extract, but there’s none of the sweetness or saltiness that usually rounds out the vanilla flavor in desserts.

So I guess I’d lean toward it not really being edible a la vanilla extract."
my dad gave me 12 pounds of dried of dried cherries.... What do I do with them?,"You are living a life I can only dream of.

You can also make something like [this](https://fortheloveofcooking.net/2013/09/wilted-spinach-with-dried-cherries-and-pine-nuts.html), or rice pudding."
"Cooked a whole chicken with potatoes, onions and carrots in a dutch oven. Can I achieve the same taste by doing it again without the meat ?","Probably not exactly, but you can likely experiment  with a few things that might move you in the right direction. The chicken is adding a few things:

1. Umami flavor. To replace this, you probably want to add at least one umami-heavy ingredient, like some tomato paste or marmite.
2. Gelatin. The fact that you described the veggies as caramelized indicates that most of the water in the pan evaporated and you got some nice browning. In meats, it's mainly proteins that are browning; in vegetables it's mainly sugars. That sort of sticky browning flavor might be in part due to browning of the gelatin that comes out of the chicken as it cooks. So maybe bloom some unflavored gelatin in your chicken stock before using it, so there will be proteins that can brown.
3. Fat. The chicken skin renders and releases schmaltz. There's no other flavor quite like schmaltz, but you can replace it with another fat that will serve the same function for browning purposes and add a flavor of its own. I would *not* go with something totally neutral like canola oil...if you're gonna add fat, might as well go with something that will add good flavor like olive oil, butter, or ghee.
4. Water. The chicken will release some moisture as it cooks. You may find that you need to increase the amount of chicken stock you use if you aren't using the meat. I think adding wine is a good move because it adds more sugars that can caramelize a bit, and also adds acidity that can offset all the richness. HOWEVER, know that browning won't really happen until the water evaporates, so you don't want too much liquid.

It likely won't come out perfectly the first time as you tweak the different variables, including the above plus what vessel you cook it in, how much time they spend covered/uncovered,  and what temperature you cook in."
*Emergency* Fish monger sliced squid head vertically in half - can I still make fried calamari for a date tonight?,[deleted]
At my restaurant we are not utilizing our duck carcasses. What are some specials I can do with this. I've tried foie gras or making a stock for the risotto tha goes with our duck but my chef isn't sold. I need an idea to show my chef that we can do something delicious with it.,"Thats depressing.  At the very minimum should be roasting the carcasses and using them to make a duck sauce.  Can also make duck rillette which is pretty easy, just slow cook and mix it all up.    Can do a little quinelle with whatever you serve the breast with.  Or serve it with charcuterie if you sell that. 

Or even something fun like a duck croquette. 

Either way tell your chef a stranger on the internet thinks he's stupid for throwing away stuff that is so useful."
How is it that adding powdered sugar to cream cheese when whipping somehow makes it *more* fluid?,"Sugar is hygroscopic, which basically means it draws water to itself.  It's pulling the water out of the cream cheese, and then it dissolves in that water.  Yeah, it's pretty wacky.

why do chefs make their pans catch fire,"It depends on what's cooking. Flambéing is just a part of cooking with high levels of alcohol. 

As for accidentally setting pans on fire that can easily happen when the flames gets too high in a pan heavy with oil or grease. People here can act like a true chef would never do that, but these people have never had to watch 12 burners while trying to fit enough food for 50 simultaneous customers on a Saturday night with a full house.

It happens, you put the fire out and 99 times out of 100 nothing is ruined. And if it is ruined chances are it was ruined well before the pan caught on fire."

Is culinary school helpful for becoming a personal/private chef?,"I’ve been almost exclusively a private chef for the last 15 years- yachts, homes etc. most staffing agencies and personal assistants prefer it on your resume, probably 80% of them. As far as being a good (and logistically proficient) cook- you’re gonna learn more of that in kitchens from more experienced cooks and chefs. You will use every line, prep, and event trick in the book when you’re a private chef."
"What is in things like raw garlic, mustard, horseradish, etc. that give them a spicy bite?","In hot mustard, it's allyl isothiocyanate.

A kind of interesting thing: tolerance for capsaicin and tolerance for allyl isothiocyanate are entirely separate and unrelated. Thus, there are people who can eat insanely hot chilis but can't eat English mustard, and vice-versa; since they operate on totally different receptors tolerance for one does not translate to the other at all."
Can you make chicken stock with raw bones?,"If you put the bones in raw, they will make what is known as white chicken stock and it will have a lighter, more delicate flavor.  If you roast them first they will make brown stock, which has a more robust flavor.  Which one you want really depends on the type of soup you're planning on making."
"Why can some doughs only be proofed for 2-4 hrs, but others up to 24 hours?","Temperature affects how active yeast is. Lower temperature will cause the the dough proofs slower while higher temp will accelerate the proof.

https://slice.seriouseats.com/2010/09/the-pizza-lab-how-long-should-i-let-my-dough-cold-ferment.html

Salt, sugar, and initial amount of yeast also affect proofing time. I'd you wanted a longer proof without retarding the yeast, you'd use less yeast."

Do steakhouses reserve lower grade cuts for customers who order well-done steaks?,"Even overdone good beef tastes better than overdone crap beef. I think it might be even more obvious because good marbling is more important in an overdone cut. A shitty poorly marbled cut gets super tough and dry when it's overdone.

How do you get noodles to mix well with other ingredients in a stir fry?,"I read a lot of these comments, and only the top comment touched on the actual technique you're looking for.

Don't stir.
___

When we need to ""stir in"" ingredients, our brain takes that literally to mean swirl in a circular motion. For most recipes that's correct, but where it's not is with (usually asian) noodle dishes.

The best way to do this is to pick up everything and drop it back down. Tongs will help with this, and you can even use chopsticks. Grab noodles, do a bit of a shake, then drop them back down. Keep picking up clumps of noodles along with other items then drop them back in. This does 2 things: 1. breaks the noodles apart and 2. Mixes the ingredients into the individual noodles.

Stirring noodles leads to exactly the situation you described.

Kenji and many other have videos on this style of mixing."

Did I just ruin this cast iron skillet before ever using it?,"Your pan is fine. it's basically impossible to ruin a cast iron pan. For some reason, Reddit think's that you need to go though some kind of elaborate process when, frankly, you're going to get exactly the kind of performance and non-stick you want/need by using the pan for days/weeks/years. 

Forget about 'seasoning from scratch' or whatever. Use you pan normally and if you can cook a little fatty food (like bacon) even better. When it's done, scrub it clean with hot water and a brush or sponge. Instead of drying it with a dish towel, stick it on the range and heat it up to dry it . When the water from rinsing it has steamed off and dried, wipe a little cooking oil on it with a paper towel while the pan is still hot and let it come down from temperature. Use this pan as your daily driver for basically everything and you'll have a no hastle non-stick surface before you know it."

How do I cook chicken thighs like the ones at Indian restaurants/Hawaiian bros?,"Lots of Indian chicken is marinated in yogurt (along with salt and the spices) for a good long while. Like 8+ hours. The lactic acid in the yogurt tenderizes the meat and the yogurt just adds a lot of flavor in general. 

In general I usually aim to cook my thighs to around 175°F internally which I find gets past the slimy stage but still tender and juicy."
How does pairing a food with a beverage work?,"I’m not a sommelier, but I am a chef. Usually the higher end pairings are not done solely by the chefs, so take this with a grain of salt.  That being said:

It’s really a lot of fun tasting foods and wines/beers/cocktails together, and the best way to determine the ultimate pairings is really trial and error.  

Some good guidelines are to pick a beverage that won’t overpower your food.  A delicate fruit pastry is not going to pair well with a big, fat, juicy red wine, but will go wonderfully with some more crisp whites or late harvest wines.

This can go both ways too.  A really fatty cut of red meat (ribeye or the like) is going to completely drown out a subtle white varietal, but will work in fantastic harmony with an old world red, or something comparable.  

Just as with anything else, there are exceptions to these rules as well.  Cured beef or ham goes great with any good European table wine (good luck getting any outside of Europe unfortunately), and some desserts are best eaten with port or sherry (dark chocolate or toasted nut-centric desserts).

In the end, it’s really all about what you like.  I personally love a glass of gewurtztraminer with a slice of pizza, but that kind of thing might get me laughed out of any serious wine conversation."

Does celery root have anything in common with milk?,"I had to do a deep dive into McGee’s *Nose Dive*. It’s hard to find anything conclusive, but it might be that you’re especially sensitive to the phthalide lactones in both (or desensitized to everything else). Phthalide lactones, especially sedanenolide, contribute heavily to the aroma of celery. Lactones, as their name suggest, are also a constituent of milk, and I’m willing to bet phthalide lactones, or at least close cousins, are also in milk as part of its grassy aroma. There’s probably some neurological mix-up happening as well that’s making your brain associate the two, or at least is mentally categorizing them closer than normal. Let me know if you have more questions and I can see if I can find the answers!"

[Paprika](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paprika#History_and_etymology)

So it appears it is the same story as with cayenne, even with Columbus, just different routes of initial popularity. Paprika went though Spain to eastern Europe where it exploded in use and spread like wildfire after hitting Britain and France.

You got two versatile peppers that bring heat and a fruity flavour that activates a lot of sensors of the mouth and tongue. It just tastes good to us as a species."

"My Father can't admit his french fries sucks, need help.","Double-frying is a better option, though it will take planning - and space.

Ideally, you need 2 fryers. One at 325F, one at 350F. Fry a batch at the lower heat until soft, then take them out & let them cool. Then finish them off at the higher temp.

Basically what this does is the 1st fry heats up all the water in the potato. the cooling lets all that water emerge & evaporate off. Then the 2nd fry crisps the outside - but all the water is gone so when you take them out to serve, that water isn't escaping & turning them soggy.

So to do this, you need to plan your batches...and have the space to lay the fries out to cool (they shouldn't be just tossed in a bowl because they won't cool fast enough & the potato starches will make them all stick together)

Edit: Just noticing you're boiling first. And that's a problem, since you're literally adding in a bunch of water that then steams off when you take them out of the fry oil & makes them soggy."
I don’t understand Al Dente,"Nah, I think you're absolutely right. It varies person to person. Some people like it almost with a dried bit in the middle that sticks to your teeth, where as some do it as its barely not mush. You can also have al dente referred to in the sense of rice, such as arbrorio used in risotto. 

Imo, fresh pasta is kinda where it all came from. There are different margins for each medium. But I feel the one you can most easily keep checking, and tell the difference, is fresh pasta. There's a pretty specific point where it doesn't stick to your teeth, but also isn't mush. Amd within that window there's a few different points. And imo, that is al dente. At which point, to each their own.

I've found that with dried pasta, if you boil it till close to the stick to your teeth point, and then turn it off and let it sit for a few minutes, it gets pretty evenly al dente.  

Imo, its meaning that its not gonna just mush when you bite it. Theres a resistance, but without the dried or stick to your teeth.  

Imagine a perfectly cooked vegetable. Its not crunchy, its not mushy, its ""al dente""."
Why does my extra food that I freeze lose taste and texture when compared to frozen food I can buy from a grocery store?,Food frozen commercially is often flash frozen which leads to less deterioration in quality due to less/smaller ice crystals forming inside the food.

Should a restaurant devein shrimp?,"Shrimp should be deveined. 

The poop toob often will contain sand. 

If you do not plan to devein your shrimp, look for purged shrimp. Unfortunately most fish mongers don't know if their shrimp are purged or not, but you can tell if you look closely at the shrimp if their bodies are translucent enough. 

If most of the shrimp have dark heavy poop chutes, they're not purged.

Purging is a process where live caught shrimp are kept in circulated water for something like 12hrs. The hold period gives the shrimp time to poo which saves you from having to devein."

Think about making soup and adding onion at the end, you get bites of onion flavor, versus letting the onion cook from the beginning and the onion flavor distributes throughout. Mainly, you're letting the water soluble flavors distribute throughout the dish."

"What makes a palate cleanser capable of cleansing palates? And what happens, chemically speaking, when a palate gets cleansed?","When eating savoury dishes, two things happen, an abundance of salt dulls the palate and fat coats the tongue, inhibiting the ability to distinguish flavours. Something mildly acidic, and usually a bit sweet, will cut thru this and re-set the palate. Thats why lemon sorbet is a frequent popular option for a palate cleanser.

Ask any cook who is tasting the same dishes over and over again in a professional setting and they'll tell you all about palate fatigue. I frequently have to ask someone else to taste a dish because I can no longer taste something rich and salty after a while- especially a thick, salty sauce. A quick chomp on a lemon wedge is the way I get my ability to taste back when working the line."

"I bought a 25lb bag of flour from Costco because it was cheaper per Oz, how do I store it and preserve it?","The following is a paragraph from The Bread Bible by Rose Levy Berenbaum:

>**Freshness**   
I have to confess that for years I never believed flour could get stale, as long as I couldn’t smell any off flavors, but I was dead wrong. I learned the now-unforgettable lesson when developing the recipe for the baguette. No matter what I tried, I couldn’t get those lovely open holes in the crumb. I called everyone I could think of, and somewhere along the line someone suggested that maybe it was the flour. What I was using was three years old. I bought a new batch and the favorable results forever changed the way I think about the shelf life of any dry ingredient. I learned that unless you freeze flour, it is essential to date it the moment you bring it into the house and then ruthlessly throw it out after 3 months if it’s whole wheat or rye, after one year if it’s white flour. No ifs, ands, or buts. As flour ages, it loses its strength. If it isn’t stored airtight, it will absorb air in a humid environment or dry out in a dry environment. Only cake flour, which is chlorine bleached, seems to have a virtually indefinite shelf life, if stored airtight. Flour isn’t expensive enough to risk wasting your time with an expired one. Excess oxidation is the enemy of good bread. In the mixing phase, a certain amount of incorporated air is desirable, but in ground flour, undesirable oxidation starts to takes place from the moment the grain is cracked and exposed to air. This is why the whole unground grain can keep for as long as five years, if cleaned and kept dry and cool, but whole wheat flour keeps for only about 3 months. A common practice in milling is to moisten the grains to make separation of the bran easier. One of the benefits of this practice is that the bran flakes into attractive little pieces instead of powdering and merely darkening the bread. If the moistening and drying is done quickly, there is no down side, but if not, the moisture is likely to activate enzymes that will cause the flour to deteriorate more quickly. If you are in doubt as to whether your whole grains are still viable after prolonged storage, soak some of the grains in water. If most of them don’t start to germinate (sprout) after 2 or 3 days, the grain is no longer alive and should be discarded.

"My aunt gave me some eggs from her chickens. I boiled one, and it's gone kinda weird. It overcooked a bit so the middle it is close to hard boiled, but the edges are like over hard, like completely solid, and then there is a white ring separating the solid edges from the middle. The solid stuff is-","I actually did a poultry judging contest once(don’t laugh, they are real). You have super fresh eggs. Like grade AA.   An egg has the yolk and two levels of “whites”. An inner that’s more firm and an outer that’s more “watery”.  As the egg ages the inner white gets looser and kinda merges with the outer.  

So a grade A, the two whites you can kinda still see the separation when you crack it(a plain white or single color plate will help you see this) but they blend together as they cook. AA, that inner white is super firm and doesn’t mix.  So the outer cooks harder, the inner and the yolk cook “normally”

"My garlic turned a sort of bright, semi translucent orange and smelled amazing. Only one clove in the head affected. What happened?","Food science major here. 

This is called ""waxy breakdown"" and it is a product of post harvest metabolism in the garlic. The precise cause is yet to be determined, but there seems to be some correlation with high temperatures and low oxygen levels post harvest. Effects like these can also be seen in other fruit and vegetables, where the temperature and oxygen level can have profound effects on the development of off-flavours. 

To my knowledge, controlled trials have yet to be done, as there is little incentive to do so (i.e. this is not a widespread problem and thus big garlic won't pay for the necessary research). 

I wouldn't recommend eating it, as it could have some implications regarding the microbial stability of the produce, which could lead to heightened levels of some risc organisms.

Please don't shame me. Frozen meat question:,"Frozen meat, packaged properly, is edible pretty much indefinitely if it's kept at the correct temperature. It's not going to spoil in the freezer.

Tapioca pearls: how do you get the perfect sweetness and consistency?,"I worked at a bubble tea shop for a couple of years so here's my two cents:

- After you finish cooking the boba, make sure you thoroughly rinse it in cold water until they are no longer hot. Aim for a temperature of a less than lukewarm, but not ice cold. This process helps retain the ""qq"" or chewy texture and prevents your bubbles from getting too soft.

-Use a lot more sugar than you think you need!!! We used something like a 1:4 ratio of brown sugar( honey works great as well) to water to soak our bubbles in. After about 30 minutes, the bubbles taste their best. They should've absorbed most of the sugar at that point, while retaining the texture.

- The 5 minute instant cook boba from the local Asian grocery store are fine, but I've been using those since I was a kid and I could never recreate store bought taste & texture. It may be worth trying to make homemade tapioca(working on this myself!) pearls or buying store quality boba like this one: https://www.amazon.com/Tea-Zone-Tapioca-Bag-Pound/dp/B007LA06Y2
If you do buy this brand, you'll notice that these bubbles crumble which is more similar to homemade/fresh bubbles as opposed to the store bought bubbles that are drier and harder

I hope this helps a lil :)

Edit: 
One more quick tip! 
If you tends to clump together, I suggest that during the rinsing process you use your hand to separate the boba. You want to squeeze the boba, like you're grabbing a stress ball, and it will separate the boba. You can use a spatula to do the separation, but I find using your hand to separate the bubbles works the best.

~please don't burn yourself, only start separating when the bubbles have cooled a bit~"

ketchup is an adaptation of a Chinese recipe with Western ingredients.

And there are still competing theories there, but most agree it comes from China. There were plant-based versions using eggplant and fish-based versions too. The early European versions were based on mushrooms. 

But you aren't going to find an ""original recipe"" because the term was used to describe a lot of different fermented savory sauces. Asking for the original Chinese ketchup recipe is like asking for the original Mexican salsa recipe. Salsa just means sauce in Spanish and there's a huge variety of authentic salsas using a variety of ingredients and recipes."

How can I make my home cooked Indian food taste as good as restaurant Indian food?,"This is coming from someone who went through the same process as you are describing a while ago. I tried the various recipes and they never tasted like the nice neighborhood Indian Restaurant food. 

Then I came upon a post on Reddit where someone recommended a particular youtube channel to learn how to make that awesome Indian Restaurant Food.

It turns out it's all about the prep and making certain key ingredients in advance.

These are:

* base gravy (mostly onions, plus carrots, peppers, cabbage, garlic, spices, oil, (I forget the whole list)). It takes about 4 hours to make it.
* Ginger-garlic paste
* Mixed powder (kind of like home made garam masala)
* Spiced oil (optional)
* spiced tomato sauce (optional IMO).
* Variety of maybe 8-10 common Indian spices.

You make/buy those in advance and then you start every dish with all the fresh ingredients that go into your chosen Indian dish.

So there will be some fresh onions, maybe some chicken, lamb, paneer or tofu, fresh or canned tomatoes, fresh peppers etc.

You start with the spiced oil, roast your spices in it, add the ginger garlic paste, add fresh onions, add the base gravy, add the fresh and canned veggies and finally add your protein, plus some finishing salt and spices to taste. 

The whole process takes 10-15 minutes or so, but you need to have all of your ingredients ready to go in advance. 

By now I've made this type of food dozens of times, and unless I burn stuff or over spice, it tastes like Indian Restaurant food every time. 

PS: the youtube channel I learned from is Julian Voigt. Start with his earliest videos to learn all the basics."
Why are pretzels in N. America depicted upside down when compared to European pretzels?,"Boy did this turn into a rabbit hole for me.  I'm a huge pretzel fanatic. Growing up in South East Pennsylvania, this was not an anomaly.  PA is crazy about pretzels thanks to our historically high German population.  I've done a bit of digging and, though I won't say it's conclusive, have an idea of why the quintessential American pretzel is often displayed differently.  

This [article](http://travelhungry.co/blog/2014/6/21/breakfast-at-backerei-frank) on German pretzels makes a very short and frank statement: ""[T]he twist in American soft pretzels is the same width as the bottom and sides of the pretzel, the twist on German pretzels is much thinner, giving you a crispy treat after you enjoy the soft body. This explains why when you see German pretzels, they usually appear ""upside-down"" from American pretzels, with the thick body on the top and the twist at the bottom."" [picture to illustrate](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/535c1783e4b0faf2733dd647/t/53b31234e4b01ed85bc17bce/1404244554110/IMG_0248.jpg?format=1500w). 

I'm not a fan of how the author simply glosses over this fact. Simply saying ""the fat side goes  up!"" isn't much of an explanation. But looking at other culinary trends, this certainly seems true.  A cursory Google image search for any croissant illustrates an overwhelming preference to depict the crescent with the nice soft, fat side up and the ""horns"" down. This same trend goes for any search of ""crescent bread.""  

What I find incredibly interesting is the WHEN that accompanies the WHY of this great American pretzel flip. I've scratched through a number of searches for old Pennsylvania Dutch (Deitsch or Deutsche... in case you didn't know... they aren't Dutch) recipes and artwork and found this beauty: [Picture](http://www.homemade-dessert-recipes.com/images/potato-cake-pretzel.gif) and [Recipe](http://www.homemade-dessert-recipes.com/potato-cake-recipe.html).  This recipe is dated 1915, and is called a pretzel cake! Most intriguing is that the accompanying picture features the European style fat-side-up orientation.  To go back even earlier, we can find that the first commercially successful pretzel factory in PA, the [Julius Sturgis Pretzel Bakery](http://www.juliussturgis.com) (founded 1861!) features the European pretzel in it's logo to this day.  Another tid bit worth mentioning is that Americans seemed crazy about hard pretzels, certainly far more than their European counterparts. I'd have to research more to be 100% sure of this, but there is certainly a well supported trend within American culinary tradition of favoring foods that travel well across long distances and are more shelf stable.  The traditional European *brezeln* was a fresh baked, daily purchase. Like with almost every other culinary element (fresh fish, fresh dairy, fresh bread...) the compact nature of European towns favored the soft, loafy brezeln, and the wide open spaces of American farm land favored the shelf stable hard pretzel.  It also made economic sense: a bakery can only sell fresh goods in its small town, a factory can sell shelf stable pretzels across the country.  A hard pretzel requires uniformity of width throughout the twist so that nothing burns in an extended baking or drying process. **[SEE EDIT]** It's my conclusion that this contributed to the American aesthetic of the uniform pretzel.  So much so that it eclipsed even the traditional soft pretzel, which eventually adapted the uniform width.

So it seems that at some point in the late 1800's or early 1900's, with the pretzel moving toward it's modern American form, the chubby-side-up/horns down aesthetic just stops working. The new American pretzel looks better with its two arches pointed up. Also, if a pretzel is being sold from a cart or hung in a shop window, it's much easier to load them onto sticks or hooks through the larger holes up top; hanging at a playful angle, arches up.  The largest hole of the German style pretzel, is not the small ""ears"" but the center, and would most likely have hung in shop windows thusly.  

This is all conjecture! But it was fun. Thanks for the great topic. Hope someone else weighs in.

*EDIT*: There's been a ton of great discussion in this thread.  The big correction I need to make is thanks to u/J_Kenji_Lopez-Alt who points out that the difference in width of the pretzel is much more likely a result of the type of dough used; Stiff dough for hard pretzels that, once rolled, carries its weight during the lift and twist motion vs. soft, enriched dough used for soft pretzels that tends to pull and sag.  Additionally, the whole hanging pretzel posit, which I felt so sure of last night, seems to be completely false.  Google ""hanging brezel"" and it looks like they're still hung from their little ears."

Is there a single thing that all fine dining restaurants do to achieve the 'flavor explosion' effect?,"It's complexity.

If you have eaten at so many places you must be quite familiar with the fact that non-fine dining (I really do hate the term ""fine dining"" though) can be incredible. However, the differences between fine dining and non-fine dining, in my opinion, is that ordinary restaurants tend to focus on one or just a few flavor aspects while high-end cooking layers a lot of different contrasting and/or supplementing flavors on top of each other, leading to an unrecognizable neural input making the diner interpreting it as something novel. Therein lies the divide between the two - i.e. while I can appreciated an amazingly perfect and well-crafted pizza for example, I know what flavor and textural aspects of the dish to expect. So while it may be the most perfect pizza in the world, it is the small differences that makes it stand out, while ""fine dining"" may reinterpret the flavor profile in its entirety due to the many other layers of the dish, and thereby surprise me in an entirely different way.

What is Crème Fraîche?,"They're very similar and can often be used fairly interchangeably except for higher heat situations where the sour cream will curdle. 

[However, here's how to make Crème Fraîche and it's shockingly easy.](https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-make-creme-fraiche-in-1-easy-step) Just combine a pint of heavy cream and a couple tablespoons of cultured buttermilk and that's it. You just leave it on your counter until the bacterial cultures thicken it to your desired consistency (depending on your kitchen temp/humidity I've found this can be between 8-24 hours). Once the thickness is where you want it, place it in the fridge to stop the process. 

I was in the same situation as you until I learned how to do this. Now, I literally always have Creme Fraiche in my fridge and use it anytime a recipe calls for sour cream. Its so good!

[Also... now that you've bought buttermilk for the creme fraiche, you can use it to make more buttermilk.](https://www.seriouseats.com/diy-cultured-buttermilk-recipe) Basically the same steps as making Crème Fraîche but use milk instead of cream. So as soon as your supply of buttermilk is running low, top it up with milk, let it thicken, and refrigerate.

Any tips for making REALLY light and fluffy bao?,"I use this ratio for making bao:
83% all purpose flour
12% tapioca flour
3% baking powder
2% yeast

/100gr flour mix use:
25gr sugar
50ml warm milk
5gr oil

The bao will have a slightly tacky surface because of the tapioca flour - which is what I am used to. The tapioca flour also brings down the protein % (which affects gluten forming)  in the AP flour and make it lighter. 

I ate a lot of bao growing up, but since I live abroad I have to make it at home now. And I second the above commenter, they will have to be fully proofed to yield a fluffy bao. Proof it twice, once before rolling and once after rolling in the steamer. You can add some vinegar to the steaming water to make a whiter bao."
Restaurants Changing To Coated French Fries - Why?,"I personally don't mind them, but no one has mentioned the biggest reason for the switch--they stay crispy for carry-out orders, as they are less likely to absorb moisture in a closed container.

What's the difference between baking and roasting when you're talking about bone-in skin-on chicken?,"An additional casual interpretation I have is that roasting and baking have separate goals. 

Roasting aims to cook at a very high hot heat in order to maximize exterior crispy ness and interior moisture—so roasting is done at temperatures above 375, with 425 being the “preferred” temp.

Baking aims to evenly cook food with consistent results. For example, a cake that doesn’t have a burnt exterior and raw interior, that also doesn’t vary too wildly due to how the oven is feeling that day. 325 and 350 being the bread and butter of baking temps.

With chicken you may choose to roast when you have skin on and bone in cuts that benefit from the crispness the skin gets from the high temps, and really any cut where maximizing caramelization is desired.  Baking will kick in when you have breaded and coated chicken where the coating begins to burn before the center reaches 165."

Otherwise, if you can source halal gelatin (or any bovine gelatin, if you're less strict but avoiding pork), you can also make your own marshmallows.

How much of a commitment is sour dough starter?,">Do I really need to feed it daily?

There are many different methods out there, but the first one I followed that worked well for me had you feed every 12 hours for the first 5 days. 

>Can I put it in the fridge to slow things down? If so, for how long?

Yes, once established (when it consistently doubles or more within 4-6 hours after feeding) you can put it in the fridge. You can feed it once every 1-2 weeks without issues. I take it out the day before I want to bake with it and feed it twice before baking.

>Can I use my sour dough starter in most bread recipes, or is it mostly centered around sour dough bread?

You can, but proofing times will be doubled or more for certain things, depending on how much of the starter you use in the dough. When you are first getting started I recommend you follow recipes that use starter until have a good understanding for how long your starter takes to proof various types of dough. During this time, you should learn about what changing the ratios in your starter achieves, and how different temperatures change proofing times. These are very important when working with sourdough. 

With pizza specifically, heat is the main source of leavening, so anything that builds some gas bubbles in the dough will work, then the heat expands the bubbles that are present. Long, cold fermentations work quite well for sourdough pizza. 

Overproofing occurs when the ethanol byproduct of the starter breaks down the gluten network in the dough. A low ratio starter and a high percentage of starter in the dough will hasten proofing times. Conversely, a high ratio starter and a low percentage of starter in the dough will slow proofing times.

How the hell do you make this egg!,[deleted]
How do restaurants work?,"Restaurants in their current form work that way because of what is called a ""brigade system"". A chef named Escoffier was the first one to think of this idea. Before his time, and really before modern restaurants, chefs would be hired to come to a house and they would attempt to prepare entire meals on their own, often getting in each others way, and causing a general clusterfuck that didn't lend itself towards efficiency. The idea of a brigade is instead of having multiple chefs working on multiple meals, you have multiple chefs each responsable for one portion of the meal.

This gives you the common positions in the kitchen...I won't get too into details, but in general, you have a grill guy that's charged with handling most of the proteins. Theres a sauce guy, he handles all the sauces, soups and hot recipes. There's a salad guy, he handles all the cold prep and salads. There's the guy whose job it is to get all the other chefs to put the stuff together at the right time. This is a horrible generalization, and there is a lot of variation in the system, but I think this gives you an idea.

So your food comes out in 30 minutes simply because of efficient flowthrough, developed from years of experience.

Let's look at flowthrough....as soon as your server walks away from your table, communication starts. If there is to be salad or appetizers, this is communicated first, so that it reaches your table first...but let's focus on the entree...you ordered Grilled Chicken with a Cheese sauce, fried potatoes, and steamed asparagus with Hollandaise sauce.

The first step starts when the ticket is received...usually there is one chef that will look at the ticket and communicate the various needs down the line. The first instruction would be to the grill guy to fire (start cooking) the chicken.

Next would be instructions to set (to make ready to cook) various items, like your vegetables and fried potatoes made to the various chefs responsable for those items.

He would also let the sauce guy to go ahead and get one order of cheese sauce ready. This cheese sauce was made earlier in the day, and only requires heating. The Hollandaise sauce is probably a make to order item, so the sauce guy will begin working on that.

As the chicken gets close to being done, the other items will begin to finish, with the timing being defined by communication and experience. The chef will get the chicken from the meat guy, the veggies from the veggie guy, the fried potatoes from the fry guy, the sauces from the sauce guy, and put the dish together and make it ready for sale.

This process can take anywhere from 5 minutes to 30 minutes depending on how involved the recipes are, and the millions of differences in quality of restaurants; i.e. a cheap bar and grill is probably just opening a can of cheese sauce for your chicken dinner, while a fancier place may be making your cheese sauce to order, and those two things take very different amounts of time.

The secret to the brigade system is simple. First, having your ingredients in place. That's prep...if you use sliced onions in your dishes, you don't slice an onion every time you need one, you slice a bunch ahead of time. Some foods are precooked, but not as many as you'd think...bacon is a big one that's done ahead of time, and almost nowhere will half-cook food, as that affects both safety and quality of most foods. There are some exceptions. Second, communication and teamwork help the system move along, being able to process multiple plates at the same time. The average grill guy that we used in this example could have as many as 50+ items on the grill at one time, depending on how busy it is.

Sorry so wordy, I love the business! And remember those guys next time...your server is the face you get to meet, but if you really enjoyed the food, ask your server if you can buy the guys in the kitchen a beer...not everywhere allows it, but that's a thing, and they'll appreciate it!"
HOW THE HECK DO I COOK 10 STEAKS,"I would sear them like you normally do and not put them in the oven right away.

Potatoes just... didn't cook after nearly 3 hours???,You might wanna check your oven temp. 2 hours at that temp shoulda burned the crap outta the bechamel and chevre.
"Robuchon's Mashed Potatoes: I understand the how, but i'm here for the why","1) This seems like an old school french method for cooking potatoes.  I've read a couple of articles that say various things - it keeps the flavor in, it keeps the nutrients in, it keeps the starches in, etc - but no actual science (from those sites).  Interestingly enough, I looked up the nutritional data for [potatoes cooked with the skin on](https://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/vegetables-and-vegetable-products/2556/0) and [potatoes cooked with the skin off](https://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/vegetables-and-vegetable-products/2558/0) and (according to them) skin on potatoes had slightly more of everything - carbs, protein, vitamins, etc so there might be something to having more flavor.

2) The butter, as others have said, is done cold to help with the emulsion.  The idea according to Cooks Illustrated, is that cold butter melts slower and it gives you more time to whisk the fat into smaller droplets that will create a better emulsion.  Warm butter melts too fast for you to break the fat up into small droplets.  

3) This one, while it sound silly and finicky (and it is).  [It does actually serve a bit of a purpose](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/how_tos/11461-how-to-prevent-hot-milk-from-sticking-to-the-pan).  Milk when poured into a pan and heated will create a thin film where ever the milk touches the pan. A little bit of water in the pan first stops this from happening.  Will this have any effect at all on dish?  No.  Will it help you clean up some?  Yup.  Is this probably something he was told to do when he started cooking and just kept doing because that's the way he was taught?  It's hard to say, but probably."

"Cheaper soda waters have larger harsher bubbles, more expensive ones have smaller softer bubbles. What accounts for the difference?","Contrary to a lot of the mythology surrounding Champagne and carbonated water, ""tiny bubbles"" has nothing to do with quality directly, only the amount of CO2. More CO2; bigger bubbles. (Temperature and nucleation sites being equal)

People often associate small bubbles with quality because higher quality vintage Champagne is aged in its bottle where it loses some of its CO2 resulting in fine bubbles. Cheap sparkling wine is not usually aged, so it retains its CO2 and has bigger bubbles.

Naturally carbonated spring water also usually has less CO2 than soda water that is carbonated during bottling, hence the association of quality and bubble size.

Carbonation levels are definitely a matter of taste. I prefer high carbonation levels, but not everyone likes the tingly burn."
Why do some foods (like bolognese ragu) taste better the next day?,"Probably because the volatile flavor compounds have time to absorb into the fat molecules for longer. Fat is an important flavor carrier, so the more time the fat has to soak up the flavor, the better. (This is also why you temper spices in Indian dishes and add the oil at the end - flavor!)"

"European alternatives to America’s Test Kitchen, Serious Eats, Wirecutter","There isn’t a great one imo, either in the EU or UK. Everything I’ve found is either sorta blog-spammy or quite old-school in its methodology (in US terms, think Consumer Reports rather than Wirecutter)

How do restaurants cut vegetables?,"This depends greatly on the restaurant. Big chains often times order in the ingredients pre-cut by machines.

For a more upscale restaurant, they have prep cooks that work in the AM. Their sole job is to do all the prep before the chefs do their work at night.

So I recommend the day before, do as much chopping as you can, or grab a friend to help if they have skills or can follow instructions well. Chop all veggies and prep any ingredients ahead that you can.  Like sauces...often times a sauce you can make in a big batch a day ahead (and can actually taste better too!). Pasta can be cooked al dente and be stored (coat pasta in a small amount of sauce to keep from sticking).

And write down EVERYTHING. List each dish & side. Then list for each dish what needs to be prepped.

From there, group like items. So if you need carrots for 2 different dishes, cut all the carrots at one time. You can then either store the cut carrots together (assuming you need the same shape and size cut for both dishes) or for ease of final cooking day, go ahead and portion it out. So when you go to mix in the salad ingredients, you are just grabbing bags or bowls of pre-measured ingredients.

This preserves your thinking power for the big day."

How to Create an Aftertaste and Layers in General,"First of all, let's define ""aftertaste"". This is just the taste that lingers on your tongue after all of the aromatic compounds have been sensed and all of the other taste compounds have been washed away/swallowed. We also have to make the distinction between aroma and taste. Aroma is what  you sense with your nose, and taste is what you sense with your tongue. Aroma is what makes a strawberry taste like a strawberry and not a raspberry, while taste is saltiness, acidity, sweetness, bitterness and umami. Aroma without taste is equivalent to smelling something, while taste without aroma is what you get when you have a cold and ""cannot taste anything"". Flavor is not specifically defined, but I generally use it as the overall sensation you get combining aroma and taste.

As for what gives an aftertaste. That is generally up to what taste compounds you have left on your tongue. More often than not the aftertaste is the prevailing overall taste compound of the food that becomes more apparent after the main flavor profile as the aroma isn't there to distract you anymore. Another way an aftertaste can present itself is if there is a fat soluble compound that isn't rinsed away as easily by your saliva, as most acidic, sweet, and salty compounds are. Especially bitter ones can be in the latter category, which is why this is more often considered an aftertaste (also because we generally think bitterness tastes bad).

So what can you do about this? Well, either you can dilute it (keeping in mind if it is water soluble or fat soluble), or you can balance it with other flavor compounds so it doesn't stand out but instead works together to form a more cohesive flavor. Diluting is easy, balancing is hard and requires some experience (but practice makes perfect).

For bitterness in general, all other tastes balances it out to some degree, but umami and acidity are particularly good for this (in my opinion).

&#x200B;

EDIT: To add on some more comments: Prolonged cooking can also alter a lot of these compounds. Some are more stable than other. For example, you can boil salt water for ages and nothing would happen with the saltiness (except for evaporation of the water), while more complex taste compounds will break down and possibly change the perception your tongue has to it. How much they can break down and how big of an impact it can have, I cannot entirely say, I'd have to leave that to an organic chemist to answer."

If you know why the smell/taste occurs, perhaps you can look into if salt breaks it down."

* One [common piece of cocktail wisdom](https://www.google.com/search?q=batching+cocktails+bitters+take+over) is that you've got to cut down on the amount of bitters when you make a large batch of a drink, or the bitters 'take over'. Is this true? Why?
* What really happens when you add water to whisk(e)y, besides lowering the proof slightly? People often recommend adding a few ml of water and leaving it a few minutes before tasting; what happens in this time?

Who do I always get a large tendon in my homemade drumsticks but not in prepared cooked chicken?,"You have to cook chicken leg so the collagen in the tendon breaks down into gelatin. People worry about over cooking chicken but that tendon will only start to break down at 160* F and it needs to stay at that temp, but not to far above (which will dry it out in a long cook) for it to continue breaking down. With fried or grilled chicken because of the temperature the collagen will breakdown quickly but with oven roasting or rotisserie the breakdown of the collagen into gelatin takes longer. So I would guess you might not be cooking your legs for long enough to dissolve that tendon, even though you may be pulling them once they reach 165* F."
What stock do chefs use?,"Premade stocks and concentrates are fine for a certain level of restaurant. Most nice restaurants will make their own.

Stir-frying contradicts a lot I've learned about cooking so far,"Firstly, stir-frying at home is distinctly different from wok-style cooking with those large burners. The former is a home method of one-pot recipies. The latter is almost only available to special kitchens.

I wouldn't say Chinese wok cooking (or any stir fry) tries to get oil ""smoking."" The wok is heated dry - without oil, and then oil is added at the last second right before cooking. This both allows for a quick non-stick surface, and prevents oil from smoking. However, in general, home stir fry style cooks food in small pieces, so there isn't as much time to let it sit and brown, so you'd like as high temp for a little time. You want the oil hot - shimmering so wooden chopsticks tips start to bubble when dipped in is a good metric - but not smoking. These temps are far below the temp of non-stick coating breakdown.

During cooking, oil is ""stir fried"" quickly with a lot of mixing to get air incorporation. Ideally, it also gets a bit burnt from the live fire, giving it a singed flavor much like dripping fat onto charcoal gives that distinctive cookout flavor.

Lastly, aromatics are not universal. Sometimes you add them in the beginning if you want to build flavor; sometimes you add them at the end as garnish. Same with starting by sauteeing onions or adding parsley at the end as garnish. Generally, tougher more root-like aromatics serve as better to cook in the oil in the beginning, like ginger or garlic, whereas 'greener' aromatics like basil or green onions should go in at the end. Exceptions exist - maybe you want a pungent garlic flavor with minced stuff at the end. Again, there is no absolute rule for cooking from an entire culture , just as there isn't an absolute rule for Western cuisines. 

For you example of Kenji vs Ramsay, I'm assuming this is fried rice recipies? Take a note on the size of the meats they're adding. I would wager Kenji is adding ground beef, while Ramsay may be adding bigger cuts. The principles of cooking in general still apply.

Just keep cooking to get a sense. Some chefs like Gordon Ramsay have to consider what British cooks have in their kitchen, and thus may deviate from 'authentic' if it just means more people will branch out, which is never wrong. I recommend following recipies to the letter the first time to try to get a sense of the goal, then adapting it the second time based on your experience/experiments."
"Ramen recipes say that you need to cool the broth immediately if you arent using it right then. How do i cool down a hot pot of soup without diluting it, leaving it out, or putting it in the fridge?","Ice bath in the kitchen sink is an easy way with no extra gear (immersion chiller, etc)."
Why is it not standard to add salt when first making homemade pasta rather than when we boil it?,"My understanding is that it effects the gluten in the pasta.  Salt actually strengthens the gluten which could result in a tougher, chewier texture. This isn't to say that you can't add a bit of salt, just that too much could have adverse effects on your pasta. By seasoning the water you are not causing problems in the dough itself."
"I've deep fried a whole turkey before and thought it was a amazing, but quite an undertaking. I have some turkey thighs, and was thinking it would be relativly easy to deep fry just the thighs as opposed to the whole bird, but for some reason there's very little info on this online.","Treat the thighs like a whole bird. Same cooking oil temp, when they look crisp, check internal temperature and you're done."
"Why does a lot of Chinese restaurant pork taste so ""porky""?",Also probably the use of lard
How can restaurants use excessive amounts of salt and not have their food taste overly salty?,"Excessive is subjective. 

When people talk about restaurants using a lot of salt they are doing it by way of comparison to home cooks that traditionally under-season their food.

It's not such a large amount that it would ruin anything, it's just more than many people use at home.

It's also a matter of knowing how and where and when to use salt appropriately as opposed to just dumping it all in at once at the beginning or end."
Ruined a large batch of fried shallots.....what did I do wrong?,"Malaysian restaurant line cook here!

Start with warm but not hot oil. Add your shallots and bring them to a rolling boil. Keep the heat relatively high until the shallots cross that threshold where they're dehydrated enough that they no longer boil and begin to get shiny on top. Reduce the heat to medium-low and stir frequently. The closer they get to being finished the more stirring they will require. During the final 2 minutes or so they need to be stirred constantly. Picking the exact right moment to remove them can be tricky and takes practice. Keep in mind that they will continue to darken for a minute after they're out of the oil. Pull them when they're 1.5-2 shades lighter than the final product. They won't become crispy until they have cooled to room temperature.

Always have your paper towel lined sheet tray and spider ready well in advance. When they're done they're done and you have to be ready. The difference between perfect and burnt is about 10 seconds. Fluff with chopsticks immediately after they come out.  Fried shallots turn out best when made in decently large batches. I recommend at least 4 cups sliced shallots and at least 6 cups oil. Do not salt them."
Is uncured Pancetta just straight up pork belly?,"The FDA regulates that a cured meat product can only be labeled ""cured"" if the manufacturer adds nitrites to it.  ""Uncured"" meat like the Boars Head Pancetta, generally has celery juice/salt in it which naturally contains nitrates.  Nitrates break down into nitrites so it's funcutally the same thing, but it's one of those quirks and unintended effects of a government regulation that has now become a marketing gimmick to trick people like my mom into thinking it's healthier because it ""doesn't contain nitrates""."
Getting Lemon Flavor into Pasta,Have you tried blooming your zest in warm oil or butter to bring the flavours out? Could also be a matter of adding more salt.
I love food - but I don't want to become a chef,"There's a huge, huge world of food that you don't even think about in your grocery store. Someone has to design and make the recipes for all those products. I work in making cpg products and it's a million times better hours and pay than restaurants."
Is gelato in Italy just regular ice cream?,"No, it's not the same. Gelato is made with less fat and contains fewer ice crystals. Interestingly, Rome recently started cracking down on subpar gelato. If too many ice crystals are found, the shop can face a fine up to $15,000

"I feel silly asking this, and I'm sorry for the dumb question, but I need help with garlic.","Frankly, I find a garlic press to be mostly a waste of time. Take a clove off the bulb, lay it flat on a cutting board, then lay the flat side of your knife over it. Bang your hand on the knife to crush the clove. Remove the now easy-to-remove peel, then dice the garlic. Or, after the peel is gone, you can send the peeled garlic through the press."
"Why braising pork belly results in fall-apart goodness, but sous-videing does not?","Acid in the wine might make a small difference in the outermost layer of meat, but the biggest difference here is temperature. Collagen breakdown isn't a binary yes/no above 160°F, it accelerates with higher temperature. (And even occurs below 160, there's just a big spike in the rate around there.)

You could go hotter if you want more tender, but in theory just cooking longer at 170 should give a better result. Maybe try 16 hours next time."

How do restaurants handle excessively starchy water?,"Restaurants use pasta cookers which have a drain and a fresh supply of water.  The excess starch foams up and runs down a drain.  Similar to an overflow drain in a bathtub. You can adjust the water flow for how mush pasta you have, how much you want to drain. It’s a simple but effective tool for cooking noodles in large quantities.  At home, just use a big ass pot or cook in batches"

2 tbsp water 
50g light corn syrup 
1/8 tsp cream of tarter 
--
3/4 c heavy cream 
2 tbsp butter

Cooked until boiling then used medium heat to cook until golden and added butter and heavy cream and stirred until smooth. Next time need to go a littler darker but all in all success.

I have 12 lbs of pears and 13 very large cucumbers that I have no idea what to do with.,"Asian style quick pickled cucumber. you mix them with sugar and salt and they taste absolutely divine with any grilled or fried meat.

"The cooking order of onions, garlic and vegetables. Can someone please clear this up? Im confused?!","The reason onions are sweated first is sometimes because the saucepan isn't large enough to allow enough space to release steam. If too much steam is trapped the onions will steam/boil this will be a different flavour than if you gently sweat them and allow their flavour to soften.
If you have enough room for your carrots and celery too and you can stop the steam from getting trapped, then sweat them together and add garlic after."

Why is it that only white people get called out as racist?,"Im black, and im going to keep it straight foward and put it as simple as possible. If you hate someone or show some form of animosity towards someone because of their race, no matter what race or skin color you are it's racist. Yes black people can be racist, yes white people can be racist. Anyone can be racist. That's the real truth. If we weren't so divided by colors and all this other crap we'd realize that its really only one race which is the human race. We all look diffrent due to being from diffrent enviroments and apart of the world but we are same race. If you take a certain animal and have it breed on the opposite side of the world its originally from, the generations to come are most likely going to change to adapt to the new enviroment. The fur may change color, get thicker or thinner etc. It's still the same animal just diffrent. But people (on all sides) are divided because in the world we live in right now everyone wants to be better than the other. It's not even really a race thing anymore it's more so about being on the top. Hopefully things will change eventually. And we can all just be ""humans"" peacefully together. Doubtful but hopefully"

Am I the only one who think Omegle is straight up creepy ?,"I just learned about this now.

The internet started with sights like this. Back before it was fast forums weren't a thing and chat rooms were.

Microsoft even had a wacky one where your chats looked like comic strips.

Anyway, talking to people you don't know must be approached with a total lack of seriousness.

Why do Pedophiles want to be part of the LGBT group,Because creeps think that somehow men being attracted to men and women to women is somehow comparable to being attracted to minors who can't consent to anything they want them to do. It's just a creepy way of making themselves feel better rather than them getting help and hopefully never even having thoughts like that ever again. Anyone who has strong urges to do anything like that with children should be on house arrest or something.

Do all pets have Stockholm Syndrome?,"No. Stockholm syndrome is a human psychological condition that many believe we have come to evolve to have for survival purposes. Way way back during the hunter gatherer days, it wasn’t uncommon for separate  human groups to fight over territory, food, etc. they would often even take members of the other group as prisoners. In order to survive, these abductees would develop what we now know to be Stockholm syndrome. The less resistant they were to their new group, the more likely they’d survive. Dogs and other pets don’t develop this because they didn’t evolve to. In fact many animals, especially dogs, have evolved alongside humans. So for that reason they actually survive better when their living in a home with humans. Also a lot of animals don’t have the mental capability to comprehend the idea of being a “prisoner” like small rodents and reptiles. As long as they’re fed and properly housed and cared for, they really don’t give a fuck."

Edit: I've done some research based on the locations that everyone says they received these messages. If this *is* from a food distribution employee who is either mentally unwell or sadistic by creeping out the masses, then I've been able to roughly triangulate where they would come from (spanning from Cumberland County to West, Lycoming County to North and Carbon County to East). West Virginia and Maryland were also mentioned. For these reasons, I believe the person(s) doing this is from the Hershey area, either from Feeser's Food Distributors or from Dutch Valley Food Distributors. Considering the distance covered, I believe they could be a driver or somebody who works for a driver. Let me know if anyone has any other info or is interested in any other questions!"

"Does anyone have a post that they thought would get popular, but for some reason didn’t?",I tried posting something on one of the memes subreddits and it had the word uncle in it (which wasn't allowed?) I'm pretty sure it was the single moderator that didn't want it just to troll me. We had a heated discussion which resulted in the CUCK banning me for three days.

Inevitably people will tell you that there is a normal way to grieve - but there are few things as deeply personal as the grieving process, and you can only embark on that journey as you see fit."

Is god more evil than the devil in christianity?,"I don't get why people think that this life we live is going to determine the outcome for the rest of eternity. Think how long is a life say 80 years here on earth compared to forever. It's not even a blip in comparison. I don't believe in the devil or hell. I think if anything you could consider this life on earth ""hell"". We are too easily manipulated, we are weak and fragile. It isn't doesn't make sense that we would have the odds stacked up against us this much to choose our fate. Especially with no solid proof that any of it is even real... I think we are here to learn lessons, and get experience, and evolve our ""soul"" or ""spirit"" or whatever you want to call it. If we choose to live life as a bad person we only are cheating ourselves and wasting this experience. God loves all of us and wouldnt torment or let us rot in hell. He wants us all to be better and become more wise. He doesn't always intervene and alter our plan too much as that could hinder our experience. What happens in this world is because of us humans.... I honestly believe that before we were born we planned out our life and and the situations we find ourselves in. And free will is how we learn. And we have some sort of guide that helps us stay on our path. A guardian angel you could say. Why do we have psychics, or deja-vu, or those times where you you say something and it appears on tv after, or when you and someone else think of the same weird thing at the same time. It's not a coincidence. I dunno thats just my belief. I would never necessarily say someone else is wrong because nobody knows 100% either way."
Does anyone else absolutely have to read the subtitles that are on the screen of any video?,Yes definitely! And one time I got a movie and the subtitles were in German and I couldn’t turn them off so I literally couldn’t watch the movie and I just spent the whole time trying to decipher the German subtitles hahaha

Is being attractive all that matters if you’re female,"That door swings both ways, unfortunately.

People have confused Love with Lust, so attractiveness is paramount.

Guys don't love the hot ones either. Typically, we use them to make ourselves feel better about ourselves. We're a bit too dumb to recognize that, so we'll never admit it, but that's the truth behind the curtain.

That's what you're missing out on, being used.

Learn to absolutely love yourself. You'll be spending an awful lot of time with yourself, you might as well make it enjoyable. Build a life that is yours outside of a relationship, so that when an opportunity comes along you know exactly what you're sacrificing to be with him. 

You are enough, regardless of how you look. Fight for yourself, and be kind to yourself while you do it. I *promise* all you're missing out on is disappointment"

But I think just being honest with this girl might get you farther than you expect. Who knows? She might just like you back! Take that leap of faith, if you don't know her, get to know her, be a gentleman, give off subtle hints that you have feelings for her, say nice things, etc. When you feel comfortable - ask her out. Even if you just want to jump straight to the question, go ahead! Do what you feel is right."

Why are math teachers so awful at teaching?,"From my understanding I think they believe that if you understand one concept you should be able use that (and assumed prior knowledge) to apply it to figure out harder things that haven't been covered, even though a lot of people need to do the actual problem to the fullest extent to understand. I think higher math is just difficult and lower math usually just comes to people who are good at it, so because they've never had to really explain it, they're bad at teaching it. Makes perfect sense to them, but it's hard getting other people to understand immediately.  I've had teachers like that who would teach us A, but then a problem on the test required A B and C. And upon review, the professor would say you should know how to do B and C from the class you took last year, but people don't always know or remember that. Then everyone's mad lol"

"If someone tells me ""don't listen to me"" and I don't listen to them, then am I listening to them?",Yeah you are listening to them technically because they gave you an order and u followed it regardless. The tricky thing is if i say dont listen to me and you listen to me....your listening to me. So either way you are listening to them. (-20braincells)

How the fuck do you respond to a compliment?,Thank you
"Is it rude to say ""bad"" when someone asks you ""how are you doing?""","Honestly, most customer service employees don’t really care. They ask that because it’s considered good customer service etiquette."
"Why do people let their babies/children choose their gender identity, but post pictures of said baby/child on the internet without their consent?","Unclear on the connection.

I named my children before I knew their gender, working out well so far.

But, I refuse to allow anyone to post pictures of my children online. No one gets why I do this, they all scoff, but just wait, in the future the privacy infringing facial recognition software will have the face of many people on record for every month of their life, but not my child. And the list of other reasons continues, like how easy it is to hijack your image and use it in deepfakes.

No one seems to know what privacy is, what the value is, what is lost when you give it up for free or cheap. If you don't value it you give it away for cheap, then when you see how other people use your lack of privacy and how rich they get off of it it will be too late to recover."

"If learning is naturally a pleasant activity for human beings, then why are schools failing so much to make students engaged?","Public schools as we know them were established by the British to create consistent workers throughout their empire. It was not meant for everyone, only those that would keep systems running. They were successful to a point. 

When it was determined that every child deserves an education, those at the time just adapted that system and we have been stuck with it ever sense. 

Schools are more about rote memorization and don’t take into account how kids actually learn. Kids should be outside, running around, with the ability to figure things out on their own with a grown up mildly directing and there to prevent catastrophe. 

Schools beat the fun out of learning so it becomes a struggle for many as they grow."

I hate kids.,"You SHOULD NOT have kids if you don't want them. You'll just end up a bad parent who scars your children. You're completely valid in not wanting kids- just don't be a dick to them. It's very simple. 

When you're old enough you could get a vasectomy or just religiously wear condoms! Good luck."

"Americans, what are the good and bad sides of your country?","Dependent on where you are moving here from will definitely change how much/if any culture shock you experience. Here are some of the issues.


Like most of the world, things aren't as stable as we would like RN. The cost of living is extremely high, even where it shouldn't be. Our schools and medical facilities are bad and seem to be getting worse. 

Also, for a country with free speech, you really have to watch what you say. While the government can't attack you for your speech, schools, corporate environments, and even home owners accociations or co-ops are mired in identity politics. You can lose a lot for saying the wrong thing, and those goal posts are always moving.

Crime and drug abuse are growing issues.


There are good things, too, though.


The USA is tremendous, and different states can feel like different nations do in Europe. Which state you choose will vastly change your experience. From people to attitudes, laws, and even the biome/nature will be vastly different from place to place. 

It takes more than 3 days, only stopping for gas to drive from east to west, and more than 24 hours from north to south. We have great roads, beautiful national parks, and just road tripping around can be an amazing experience.

The US is extremely diverse, and in most large cities, you can find a bit of home through dining and organized cultural communities.

If you're willing to work hard or are entrepreneurial, there is still a lot of opportunity to be had, and money to be made.

Most Americans are friendly people. Many people visiting the US that I speak to have the notion that it will be a violent place or that we are all shooting at each other constantly. This is surprisingly rarely the case, regardless of how our news looks. Again, the US is a massive place, and distilling down all the evil into a concentrated news cycle looks a lot worse than it is.


Overall I think its a pretty good place to live. I wouldn't choose anywhere else anyway."

do twins have the same sized dick,"No they don’t. Actually there always to tends to be a twin that’s slightly larger and healthier than the other due to one twin getting more nutrients in the development in a womb. Therefore as they exit the womb and develop one twin will be slightly shorter, physically weaker etc. 

Now when it comes to their slim Jim size I would assume that what I said also applies to it. So one twin will have a larger slim Jim than the other"

What food is actually American?,Cornbread
Can I take a rat home?,If you'd like a pet that carries disease including the bubonic plague then by all means.
"If animals could talk, which species would be the rudest of them all?","Honestly: dogs. Why? Because they would TOO honest and not realize how rude they are-- like ""I love to lay on my fAT owner because his fat legs keeps me comfort when I laydown when he feeds me his food like I'm his master"

"Why is it ethical to put down terminally ill animals, but not people??",[deleted]
Will I die?,"I think you should see a doctor. Also I don't think they would put anything too toxic in tablets that clean food related things. If you can't see a doctor the try to stay calm and maybe drink some tea(?) For future please be careful, I hope nothing dangerous will happen."
Does anyone else find “cute” girls to actually be hotter and sexier than traditionally “hot” girls?,Yes
Co dependence (triggering),"Okay.

One: No. You’re not wrong for thinking that what they did was completely messed up. Because not only was it messed up, it was abusive. The BIGGEST problem with what your parents did was putting you in that situation in the first place. What in God’s name would make them think that staying with a r@pist for any reason would be a good idea? I can understand them wanting to protect you by keeping you close, but they went about it in all the wrong ways.

Two: You’re already taking plenty of good steps forward to move on from it, especially seeing a therapist to talk about it. The problem is the second to last sentence. A therapist has two jobs: to listen to people that are hurting and to help them take steps to heal. Your current therapist is only doing half of that. What you can do is ask them for recommendations on how to cope, but if they continue to just ask questions instead of going to the root of the problem and help fix it, you need a new therapist. As for steps you can take right now, if you’re having trouble sleeping on your own, it might help to get something that you can latch onto so you won’t feel alone (a body pillow, a plushy, etc.). I wish you the best of luck and feel free to PM me if you need to talk to someone."
"Why do we look good in the mirror, but not on camera?","When you look in a mirror, you're seeing yourself from twice the distance you are standing from that mirror. In other words if you're standing 3 feet from the mirror, you're seeing what you look like from 6 feet away.

When you take a selfie you're only seeing yourself from an arm's length away.

This changes things because of perspective distortion: https://oohstloustudios.com/the-science-of-the-selfie-no-you-dont-really-look-like-that"
Am I wrong for feeling violated?,"You're not wrong to feel violated. I'm sorry i don't have much more to say, and I'm sorry to hear what you've been through, but every single one of those people was in the wrong when they did what they did. I know it's easier said than done, but you shouldn't hate yourself for not seeing what they were doing or doing anything, as kids we're naive and we don't always know what to do. On your part, it's not your fault at all and you shouldn't blame yourself, it's all on them. You should find someone to talk to about this."
It's the small stuff that matters.,"I am MUCH older now but when I was a kid I hated high school. My school was filled with either rednecks, who were violent and on drugs, or very rich kids who were obnoxious. We were not from there and we lived in a very rural area and so I didn't like any of it. 

My grades started going down and my parents were puzzled and annoyed. I loved doing artwork and so reading, art, and music were my only interests. 

My family used to watch Jeopardy and I'd sit there and get most of the answers correct. My mom looked at me and said, ""I don't know why your grades are bad, you are very smart!"" and that flipped a switch. I didn't know I was smart until she said it. 

The same went for my artwork.

I went on to become very educated and have won several art contests. 

Make sure you talk to your mom and find out about her."
Does anyone feel empty?,This feeling of emptiness is like filling a bottomless hole.
Is anyone NOT afraid of death?,"Well, that's a very logical thought.
You see, death is natural, it's something that it's going to happen sooner or later. Its not something special, it's natural and logical. So, it doesn't have sense to be afraid. As a Estoic person I prefer to mentally prepare and accept death and  the fact that everyone could die, tomorrow , next week , next month, etc. Live the moment, live the today without thinking in the tomorrow, appreciate and show your love to people, because someday they will go away and they are not going to return.
(Carpe diem quam minimin crédula postero)
(Memento mori) remember that you are mortal and your are going to die. Take advantage of your time , make a contribution to your family, to your community, to the world, live the best life you could possibly live."
How can I get karma points? I keep commenting on posts but my points don’t ever go up! Help!!,Don’t be republican or a dick and you’ll get some
Do you think there is a segment of the population that will wear a mask for the rest of their lives?,I wouldnt be suprised. People wear them in cars and during video calls so..
Is it inappropriate for a single woman to give a married man a gift for no particular occasion?,"Bring it up to the wife, & say “hey I have some tea I wanted “husband” to try. I just wanted to let you know beforehand so it doesn’t come off as creepy or anything” I’m sure she’ll be like “it’s cool!”"
theres a goose in my backyard what the hell do i do,"My aunt got a call from the elementary school saying that one of our geese were in the playground (we own ducks) and she had to come get it. Except when she got there it was a wild Canadian goose. She chased it down, grabbed it and brought it home. 
Point is. My aunt might be able to help you out."
When will everything just be considered plagiarism?,It be funny if this was a repost
Do birds have peepees?????,"Haha, birds have both cloakas. Something like a vagina.  
They rub them together like two mouths touching and in one mouth is sperm"
Why does racism only work one way?,"I have noticed that If I called a person of colour a name, i'd get called a racist. Reverse the roles and it's okay. That may just be what I've experienced but meh. (I should clarify I javen't been racist)

As other's have said, I believe anyone can be racist"
Why is Reddit so toxic?,"Only been on Reddit for a little more than 2 weeks. But it seems that people who get downvoted usually post something that is offensive, unpopular, unreasonable, or controversial. Don't worry about it though, it's the internet, not much you can expect from people online. Hope you have a good day, man!"

Why people hate Donald Trump?,"Oh not to that extent. 

And some people don't hate, just dislike and get annoyed/irritated.

But for those who hate, it may be because of how he handled the coronavirus issue.

At first, he denied it. It was on the news that time, and on social media. 

Then, reports started rolling in about widespread infections in the country. But, he was slow to move. Countries like China(the literal epicentre of the pandemic) and South Korea were quick to move and try to stop it. For example, quarantining an entire area, like can't even travel by train outside that kind in the case of China. And this happened really quickly, so much so that China was praised for it's quick response in disaster control even when they were right smack in the  middle of the chaos.

And as a note, the US is by no means a poor country. In fact, resources available to it in terms of hospitals and finances and manpower are quite high. But response times were so slow that you had reported cases rising drastically by the day.

Not to mention the prank tweets he did which got some people harmed when they followed them. Might be partly their fault but when your country is one of the worst performers you don't want to lose their trust and think you're not taking this seriously.

He started to hoist blame on others, and say that he took it seriously from the start and all that when things got really serious. The news and social media picked up on that.

Not to mention the lack of support from the government at the local level in terms of crucial ventillators, where states were actually competing for them. Of course, due to the lack of preparations beforehand.


Might seem that he's a disappointing president, but to some, their grandparents died because of his carelessness. For some, their friends died because of him. 

This is made worse by the fact that he's a billionare. Someone who seems so far away and doesn't seem to care about them. Average people are more closely connected and relatable to average people than billionares are. Trying to explain away his mistakes may be to some as due to negligence instead of ""everybody makes mistakes"". ""He should've have helped us"" ""He's still playing around"" ""He got all this money and didn't spend a cent on us"" etc.

And, his mistakes were also present in earlier cases, such as the US-China trade war.

His character now seems to many as lousy and terrible and selfish. After all he has done, and all they have lost and suffered, some may choose to hate him. Especially with his big promises during his campaigns.


For many, he's a joke of a president. For some, he's an enemy.


I say this as an outsider, and seeing all the news reports 
about him makes him look like a joke. Worse than just shoving a random person into that position kind.

But that's just my opinion:)"
"Ladies, does it matter?",I’m a woman and I open doors for anyone like you but to me it doesn’t really matter. I see it as more of a nice thing to do.
Is this normal?,"I think this is normal. Happens to me all the time. The clearest examples I have are of when I hurt myself as a kid. I once got rope burn so bad it tore a decent chunk of skin off of my fingers. I remained calm, assessing the damage and trying to clean the wound even though it stung like hell. All my friends kept asking if I was ok, and I shrugged it off. Then I called my mom. As soon as I said “mom” I started blubbering and sobbing about it. 

Same thing happens when I don’t address something small that bugs me until it becomes a problem. As soon as I open my mouth, I break down. It can be about serious things, or stupid things my anxiety amplifies over time. But I hardly ever cry unless I’m actively talking to someone about it."

Is there a secret that you haven’t told anybody?,"In 1968, shortly after I turned sixteen, I changed a flat tire on a Chevy Nova for a curvy thirty seven year old red headed woman, and we had an incredible torrid seven month affair. Never told anyone, not even my friends or women I married."

I'm 17 and I haven't talked to anyone my age in 10 months. How do I get out of this cycle of isolation?,"Hey, I don't know how to help or anything. But I just wanted to say I totally feel you. Most of us around your age are feeling the same way. I hope things get better man."
How to explain suicide to a child?,"Depends on how old your son is.  Depends on a few things, actually.

This is a tough one.

I would recommend waiting until your son asks you about his first dad.

If your son has not had his biological dad in his life for years now, he is used to not seeing him or knowing him.   You could tell him now, and he may not care or comprehend.  He may care more when he gets older and that may be a better time to tell him since it will be more relevant and he'll be older and able to understand it.

Assuming your son is 6 years of age, and he doesn't have any real feelings or knowledge of his first dad, you might be in the clear in telling him now.  I wouldn't say it was suicide, but you could say he passed away.

I would wait until your son brings him up ""Where is my first dad / can I go see him"" and then you break it gently to him that he is no longer living.  You can withhold information and it's not lying; you don't have to say it was suicide.  You will have to get creative here but really, only you know best - you're his mom!"
Do we actually look more like what we see in the mirror or what we see on camera (like phone camera)?,"Mirror. Camera may not have the best resolution, and it doesn't feel as real(e.g. filters, lighting adjustment, shutter speed changing how bright/dark you look, auto focus on your face etc.)

Mirror just reflects what others see as best it can."

Why do characters in tv shows I watched as a kid seem to have higher voices than I remember?,"I think it's because everything is relative. They probably had what you deemed as ""normal"" voices back before you yourself hit puberty. Their voices in shows didn't get deeper like yours did as we all grew up a little.

Why are so many people against wearing masks? Why were they in the first place?,This pandemic really has shown the very high levels of stupidity and selfishness.
Is it normal to still have a comfort plushie at almost 20 years ?,Do whatever the fuck you want to do and fuck anyone that says otherwise
Is it just me or are years really getting worse with time?,"I don’t think the years are necessarily getting worse but rather, we’re more exposed to the atrocities and sufferings across the world because of the internet (however, it is to note that because of the pandemic, the world is generally comparatively worse than in recent years). Wars still occur across the world but compared to the 20th century, there are less wars/wars of smaller scale now. Generally though, the quality of living has increased in terms of access to healthcare, education (esp. with the internet) and while there are still many, many problems within society (e.g. healthcare being too expensive), we as a society has advanced greatly. Something that has most definitely gotten worse with time however, is climate change."

That exactly what my mom is doing for me and honestly I'm just grateful she's going to give me a car in general.

mention once they cry about it then you let it slide they do it again. Girls always cry when they get caught cheating. You have to put your foot down or you will just keep getting taken advantage of. Sometimes you have to do things for yourself even when it might upset someone else but that’s life if you never learn to do that people will walk all over you."

"If Earth had a ring, would we be able to see it?","It would depend on how big the ring was, and where on Earth you are standing.

At the equator, a ring would be a thin line in the sky directly overhead; if the ring was too thin you might not be able to make it out at all, but if it was larger you'd be able to see a thin, gray strip crossing the sky.

As you moved closer to the poles, it would be easier to see planetary rings, they would be a greyish strip in an arc in the northern or southern half of the sky (the opposite of whichever hemisphere you're currently standing on).  The thicker the ring, the more clear it would be.

A planet the size of Earth that did have a ring would likely have a very small, thin ring that would be extremely hard to see, and it would go away after a few hundred thousand years or so due to gravity pulling it into the atmosphere.  Our planet just isn't big enough to have an impressive ring system like Saturn's."
What's wrong with me?,"Hey man this is a great and serious question for sure. I’ll give you my perspective. 
I am a pastors son, grew up with a great family who raised me right with very high moral standards and ideals, especially in regards to sexual purity.... but I’ve always struggled with accepting it for myself (that’s a quick sniper of another long another story for another time).
 
I always felt the same way, that I was not ever going to have sex before marriage... but when I was 17 I began dating a girl who didn’t share the same ideals and had a totally different concept of sex and marriage. She didn’t hold sex as an act to the same standards: it wasn’t a serious moral decision to her. The really rubbed off on my (no pun intended idontthink) and next thing I knew, we crossed all four bases, and I was no longer a virgin. 

Afterwards , I felt like I had  to keep it a secret to my family. My dad would kill me and my mom would be disappointed and sad for me. I’ve committed adultery- an intense sin... but at the same time the desire and love that came from it never seemed bad to me?

But we broke up and she ditched me and afterwards I felt like it was all for nothing. I had extreme guilt, both Bc I did that and lost it to someone who wasn’t going to be my wife, but also because I tasted what it actually felt like, and desired to do it again. 

I think what I’m trying to say is, it’s about whether you can be honest to yourself about what you really desire, and your family and friends opinions and personal life really does dictate part of that. If you feel like you will regret your decision, remember that you can never go back and change it once you’ve done it. I have now had sex with multiple girls and am more accepting and comfortable with my actions... but at the same time , in the back of my mind there is still the guilt and shame that comes with my upbringing: what if I’m a sinner? What if I’m judged by it? 

Just be honest with yourself. There is nothing wrong with wanting to be chaste. The fact that you’re not even religious and still have doubts makes me think that you maybe should wait, but if it’s the right person, then perhaps not....

Hopefully that wasn’t all bullshit to you. Hope you figure it out and my heart goes out to you"

Do you personally believe that somebody can be an animal lover but still eat meat?,"TL;DR - Vegetarian says it's okay, but everyone should eat less because carbon footprint

I had the same dilemma, OP

I think you can still be an animal lover and still eat meat.  Humans are generally pretty detached in regards to where their meat is coming from and disconnect themselves from the reality that it used to be alive.  

I wasn't able to disconnect myself from it and stopped eating meat back in 98.  I'm not going to try to convert you at all  (I hate when people do that.)   I guess you can be a meat animal lover as long as you're grateful for the meat you have and aren't wasteful with it.  

Each person's reasons for giving it up are their own and it's not okay to push your beliefs on anyone.  The only thing I'd recommend in your case is to try to have a meatless day or two a week; it'll reduce your carbon footprint and it might make you feel better about the guilt you're having."

It used to actually prevent me from doing things, but now I’m learning ways to tell myself to just do it anyway. Do it nervous, do it anxious. Because usually stressing about doing the thing causes way more anxiety for me than actually just doing it. And you’ll feel proud of yourself after too!"
Does anybody else ever think about old friends and/or acquaintances?,"I think about my old best friends sometimes. But the fact they’re no longer in my life just shows how things change, and how people move on. I wouldn’t really want to reach out to them just like they don’t reach out to me, we had wonderful times when we were friends but so many years have passed in not the same person anymore, and if I was to try and rekindle that flame I would have to pretend to be someone I’m not. It hurts thinking about people who once occupied big parts of our lives, but it’s a relief there’s now room for even better friendships that may end up lasting longer than the ones we thought were the deepest."

Child dating,14 and 16 is whatever. 12 and 16 is alarming.
Do women generally get horny,">As a teenage male I Know there is nothing more horny than I

Fucking nailed it dude haha"
What were you doing on the morning of 9/11 ?????,"My boyfriend (now husband) was sleeping over at my apartment.  His cell phone kept ringing and ringing.  It was his buddy telling me to wake him up and turn on the TV right away! There was a sense of urgency in his voice. We did as he said, and sat there surprised and not fully understanding what it was that was happening. The news people were saying a plane accidentally flew into the first twin tower. Then a little bit later..the 2nd plane hit the 2nd tower and we were like WTF is happening!? Then the words Terrorist ATTACK were being thrown around. Then the news started talking about the other planes that were hijacked and where they may be headed. It was scary wondering what was happening. The atmosphere of the country changed after that. It went from being pretty chill and relaxed to SUPER high anxiety.  They would have this color chart on the TV (mainstream news) that went from green to red. It seemed like it was always on yellow or orange for the LONGEST time, and you would tune in daily to see what the terror alert color was going to be for the day. Like how MUCH do we need to be scared kind of thing is how it felt. I remember hearing some Commercials or movie scenes that were coming out had to be changed because they depicted a plane crash and you couldn't show that for a long time, as it may be offensive.  I really MISS pre 9-11 days. Things haven't felt the same since. I didn't cry back when it was happening as I was 21 and didn't really understand the scope of what was happening. Now, when I watch the footage on youtube,  I cry. I mourn the poor people that suffered, I mourn the families who's lives changed forever, and I mourn the way things felt BEFORE this tragedy ever occurred."

How do I stop caring about what people think?,"Well, that's a really good question.

What value do other people's opinions bring to your life?

That's a bad question, bad me, what I mean is, whose opinion matters, why does it matter, and what influence does it have on you?

I actually extract *all* of my value from other people. To such a degree that a breakup or the end of a important relationship makes me worthless to the point of suicidal ideation.

I literally have no sense of self, I am committed to being whatever makes other people happy.

This is very detrimental, how much do you identify with that?

How high and how low does a person have the ability to make you feel?

How much power do they actually have?

Who are you and when do you find yourself sacrificing who you are to make others happy?

Think about all of that, come up with some answers, even if they're temporary.

Think about who you are again, and the person you want to be.

Then ask if those people with power deserve to have that power.

Those that do should only be your absolute closest of friends. People you trust, that you can rely on. There aren't many.

Give yourself permission to sacrifice something for those people, what you consider fair, but create a point where you'll bend no further. Decide which parts of yourself are non-negotiable and defend it with everything you have.

Value yourself for the person that you are. Require nobody else's opinion to determine who you are, what makes you happy, what you enjoy, etc. 

Love the person that you are and defend that person like you would your best-friend. Don't put up with people disrespecting you, putting you in positions you don't want to be in, or who go out of their way to make your life more difficult. Don't give crummy people the power of relevance.

I had to tear a lot down to rebuild and figure this out, I apologize if I'm not making a ton of sense, or if what I'm saying sounds cliche, it's just the logical process I put my brain through in order to start answering your question.

How do you stop it?

Identity it. Establish boundaries. Adjust behavior.

Sounds simple but it can require a lot of soul searching."
Why do so many people think all Christians hate gays?,"It's not such much Christian's ""hating"" gays, but there is a widely common disagreement with homosexuality and although they might not hate you or openly show dislike, it goes against their beliefs. I would argue that most Christians are adapting to these progressive times and learning to not base their judgements off just one Bible verse, but also off other verses such as ""love thy neighbour as yourself"", or ""all people are made in God's image"".

In the past it was easy for Christians to hate gays because acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community is a relatively recent thing, however as the world progresses around them so are they.

In saying that, there are both religious and non-religious people who will show hate and anger towards you and others in the future, but with confidence we can now say that, that is purely an opinion and an ignorant one at that."
World War III allies,Honestly I fucking hope that it doesn't happen. That's the best scenario... If it happens I fucking hope that EU won't be involved because I'm scared as fuck. Anyways I think that EU holds together. Dunno anything about America but EU kinda owes them... Sorry that I'm not much of a help but honestly just the thought of WW3 scares me...

Legit Question: Why isn’t Trump in jail?,"What law did he break? Honest question, I don't follow politics."
What's the point having sex scenes in horror movies?,It works via the concept of “sex sells”. Simply some people will watch it just for the nudity
I believe in a higher power but I don't believe in a religion. How do I identify myself?,A Theist. Note the space between a and theist.
Does 'gender' just mean what you want to role play as now?,Give your thanks to Twitter. They screwed up everything for us.
What should I talk about with my grandma?,Ask her to tell you stories of when your mom/dad was a kid - the funniest/most embarrassing thing they ever did. What was she doing when she was your age? What did she want to be doing? Did she ever travel? Do you have an old photo album that you can bring? Have her tell you who the people in the pictures are and what she remembers about them. This could be the one and only time you'll ever hear these stories. Treasure the moments.
Do I have strokes before going to bed?,I.. really don’t know. Check with your GP when you have the chance.
"You collect your sperm and then become a woman. If you fuse it with your egg, does the kid end up a clone??",Get out of your mother's basement and go see the sun
those who raided the capital should be displaced and be removed from citizenship,"I would just throw them in prison with rioters who set buildings on fire, and destroyed businesses that were already struggling due to Covid. Let them get at it with each other. Interesting mix of neo nazi trash, rednecks (may not be neo nazis), career criminals, and the college know it all hippies."
"In the word scent, is the S or C silent?",I'd say neither are silent. Scent and cent and sent sound nearly identical but there are subtleties in the pronunciation.
Rude on Reddit?,"No matter what, you're under no obligation to respond at all. In general, you probably have better things to do than worrying about someone who's being so inconsiderate. 

If you do want to respond, do so in the same way you'd want someone to reply to you. Be polite, civil, and try to take the high road. Remain level headed, argue in good faith, and try to consider the other person's perspective, even if they won't do the same for you. That's my 2 cents. Good luck!"
Dog doesn't go in hallway since my other dog died,"I am no expert on dogs...but yeah the dog may just be really sad/ depressed. I lost a dog in 2017 and my other dog grew really depressed and when that same dog died in 2020 the puppy grew depressed (she died 21 days later). I am no expert on dog behavior, but love that dog and show the dog how much you care"
I think I'm gay,i mean you could pretend to like women and lead a lie for your entire life but you would probably feel unsatisfied.
If you have sex with a clone of yourself is it classified as incest or masturbation?,I honestly don't care at this point. I'd fuck me.
Why do people give awards to ads on reddit?,I think they just buy them themselves. That way people think the ads have good products.
"Those that can fall asleep instantly, how?",One bullet
"Why do people use ""You are adopted"" as an insult?","I have never seen anyone using it, but if anyone really does use it they are retarded"
"When a porn actor takes his clothes off, is he puting his uniform on?","Yes, it has a name......birthday suit"
"Is it okay to be proud of being a straight, white male?",As long as you don’t hate on non white gay ppl it’d alright

Where’s the best spot to hide a dildo/strap-on in a small room?,in your ass
Men can be victims of r*pe/abuse/objectification. Why do so many people try to deny it?,"People don’t like to accept that which isn’t familiar to them. What I mean by that is; history portrays men as using women for personal gain. We see child marriages, we see the push for legalized prostitution in the Gold Rush era (and other eras as well), we see concubines serving emperors and kings. History sees men not valuing women, but using them, and enjoying using them. Your concubine displeases you? Have her banished or killed. You’re Henry the 8th and your wife doesn’t do what you want/is too old/gives you only daughters? Have her killed. Women are expendable  through history because once they stop being what a man wants them to be, they’re seen as worthless. So we as a society have seen this through the years, and we’ve seen how sex has become an achievement to be gained, something to be worshipped and achieved. It’s immediate gratification, just like the men throughout history wanted and were seen to enjoy. And society doesn’t like to see anything different; we’re familiar with that view and almost can’t comprehend men actually valuing and cherishing women. So when men are assaulted, we automatically assume it was something they wanted, as men for thousands of years have wanted women. Our first thoughts aren’t of the individual, but of the society and society standards. It’s easier to believe women because historically women are the more common victims. I’m not saying it’s right, I’m offering an explanation. That’s why I think, anyway, that people deny it and brush it off. They think “sex is all men have wanted for thousands of years, and here you are complaining about it? Yeah, right. I don’t believe that for a second.” It’s a lack of compassion and value for an individual"
"What things make you happy in life, big or small?","Sharks, sharks are really cool in my opinion."
Trans woman,"Does it matter? If your doing it because you love her, then who cares about the options of others"
What does IDK mean?,Irish dick killer
How do you tell a guy you aren't interested politely? I Haven't really engaged with him but I don't want to lead him on,"You say ""Hey, I know we haven't been close or anything but I just wanted to say up front that I'm not interested in pursuing anything with you at this moment""

That's literally it, and if he's not a psycho he'll say ""Thanks for being honest"" and that'll be it. Trust me, most rational guys would be much more irritated if you just ghosted him."
How are some people so neutral?,cuz it's a pain to argue
Is it wrong for my mom to do this?,Yes. Play a sport you love. Dont let them force you into things you do not like. However if she is doing it for exercise because you don't do any then i don't see the problem.
I'm so embarrassed I hate how my mom she's all in my business,"I don't know what to do as I don't know our mom, but maybe convey this to her more clearly, as in say ""Mom you're too damn clingy and I want my basic fucking privacy, understand?"" Okay maybe not like that but you get the gist.

Your mom does sound strange though, ngl. If it goes too far one day just tell her she needs to back off.

EDIT:

>Shes forcing me into religion 

Just saw that and that's where I think it really needs to stop (not trying to tell you what to do though)... If she's genuinely trying to force that upon you hard then push back harder. Privacy is huge indeed, and it sounded like your mom has some issues, but religion, at least in my mind, is where it gets even more fucked up."
Does anyone want this stupid fucking hugs award,Please hug me.
is it weird to be friends with people who don’t speak the same language as you?,"I don' think so. When I was living Germany, I made friends with a polish guy who did not speak German or English. We got along very well, and I still have good memories about it all. Also helped that I learned Polish and he English. I'm also a language nerd, so this  is right up my ally lol. Most people don't even bother talking with people who don't speak the same language, so I say kudos!"
School,"I know this might not be what you were looking for, but try being your own commentator. Like:
“OP’s lying in his/her sofa again. OP will get up and do this/that.” 
I’ve heard it helps! :)

Also, happy cake day"
Am I Entitled?,No. I’m 16 and I work for a construction company. You have every right to go out and get a job to earn some money for yourself
Is it ok to not know what you wanna do with ur life at 22?,it's only on the brink that people find the will to change. Only at the precipice do we evolve. This is our moment.
"When you dream, do you dream in first or third person?",I've never had a third-person dream. Always in the first person :/
Twitter has so many goddamn sensitive users. Why?,"People are jerks and we don't matter. I've been completely black pilled by all the bs going on rn... I just got told to take responsibility for my actions by a chick who brags about fucking her dog and masturbating over how upset it makes people.

It's over."
Why? Just why?,"I was like that before, now i just take like a couple benadryl an hour before bed sometimes and i stay asleep all night .try not drinking anything with caffeine in it like 5 hours before bed, also nothing sugary."
How long till we hear of the first poor kid named Covid by their maniac parents?,To late.
Why do we need the word Lesbian? It makes just as much sense to call Both genders Gay,[removed]

you can post memes on r/FreeKarma4U and your posts won't get removed there.

Is it common thing in the US to make your kid pay rent?,"My parents made me pay rent as soon as I graduated high school and started working full time. It was only about $80 a month which is basically nothing at all. But I at least had a concept of responsibility and what not which I think is important, and it also helped me understand the importance of saving money. I know so many people in their early 20’s who have no concept of money or adulting."
Why do we lie to ourselves?,"Good question, I'll just tell you why later"
"Is Heaven real, and will o see my dog there.","I personally am not religious, it’s up to what you believe in something like this. Anybody else’s opinion is fairly redundant for situations like these, as nobody knows for certain and nobody can tell you what to believe in. The Bible itself (assuming we’re talking about Christianity) never specifically states whether our pets go to the afterlife, or even all animals in general. Furthermore, humans are capable of making “good” and “bad” decisions, which is ultimately what places an individual in heaven. Animals unfortunately can’t really do this. It’s up to what you believe in - I’m sorry for your loss"
Would you let someone look through ALL of your photos on your phone for $100? 👀 📱 💵 🤔,"Yes, my phone is just filled with pictures of my dog and old dead memes that 2 years ago me decided to screenshot and never look at again. Free 100 bucks and nothing lost."
Is this sexual manipulation/ sexual harassment (please read),"I can't conclusively say anything as I'm not you or in that relationship and you should just talk to her about it.

&#x200B;

However yes, on paper, it sounds like she's just manipulating you. Not be a a dick per say, but she sounds like a bitch. If you're not happy around her, then tell her why and try to fix it. Or don't whatever you feel is best to do."
Is this weird?,I think that would be thoughtful actually. I visited some relatives graves in Vienna and the cemetery was so unkempt with broken headstones. It was sad to see it.
Is it normal to be afraid of your friends?,"I don’t think they’re real friends if they are treating you like that. When they’re physically hurting you and/or you feel uncomfortable to be yourself, that’s not good. They sound emotionally abusive as well"
It just makes me feel weird lol,i guess reddit wants you to know and acknowledge that your posts or feelings or whatever is valid.
Maybe the FBI lol,"Probably another app/ad. Hard to tell from your explanation. The fbi is not connecting you through calls and stopping your music. They’re just listening and watching you.

Why do kids like me so much?,"Small children are kind of like cats.  Big stranger coming up to them, invading their space, and trying to interact with them with no warning?  That's scary and they'll run away from you.  But if you come around, ignore them and give them space, they can observe you on their own terms.  They don't feel threatened, so they stare at first, then come towards you slowly and then see that you still aren't acting threatening.  So you're not a threat, you're cool, and they feel comfortable around you.  Source: Mom of 1 toddler and 2 cats"

I don’t understand why people say you’re not bad at math you just don’t study enough or you’re lazy ? What?,"Thank GOD someone feels the same way as me. I see a lot of people in the comments saying “well maybe you really aren’t trying hard enough” or “you need to ask for help” like we haven’t tried that already. Not everyone can do math, just like not everyone can read or write. I don’t understand why people can’t understand that. I excel in pretty much every subject until it comes to math or any science that involves math (I’m great at it otherwise). 

Some of us truly are just bad at math and it’s not a “mindset” or whatever. I have no problem doing math when I can understand it, but most of the time it’s a bunch of numbers on a page that I just can’t make any sense out of. I prioritize my math classes and receive all the help and tutoring I can get, but I still do horrible on tests and homework because it just makes no sense to me. We can’t help it."
"I'm scared that dad will physically abuse me, what should I do",My advice is to get evidence of your father's outburst (preferably a video but at least audio) then show it to your mom if she wants to she can try to get full custody of you. Sorry I can't provide anything more.

What would happen to my body if I get cut in half by a string that's 1 atom wide?,I didn’t know that I wanted to know the answer to this question until now
How does it feel to have a c*ck and b*lls,"I rarely think about it, except when it gets in a weird position or compressed by my pants.  That's never fun."
Did newton really die a virgin?,"No, by creating calculus he fucked all of us."
"Why do people have to ask you,"" Are you a Republican or a Democrat?""","FR I never understood why people are so hell bent on ""democrat or republican""
Not only are those not the only two political parties, but also we have the option of being independent. Like me, I don't think the idea of political parties is necessary so I don't identify with any of them. Whenever I say that, people always get mad at me. Or they try to tell me what my political party is... Like.. What?? They ask what I am and I say I don't identify with a political party and they always say either ""Oh you're definitely a fucking liberal, aren't you?"" Or ""I know you're just another democrat.""

It's so weird to me"

Update: Don't try it."
Is it ok for a 13 year old boy to want cuddles,Yes 100%
Why do people hate that I don't talk much?,"My husband is like this. It drives me crazy because I really want to talk to him about anything and everything. I want to share and then hear his input and opinion, but he rarely has either. It makes me feel like what I'm saying is too small and too insignificant to warrant any real thought from him. It makes me feel foolish to say multiple sentences and then realize I'm in a monologue."
Can you tell me something sweet or good about your life?,[deleted]
Why are americans so scared of the word retarded?,No one is afraid of the word. The word was used commonly for many years but it is extremely unkind for people with Down syndrome and other chromosomal issues. Those communities educated people on how they felt when that word was used. Mental retardation was the common name for it. Typically when someone is called “retarded” they are doing something dumb or stupid. For someone that has Down syndrome that was be extremely offensive to hear. They are not dumb or stupid and it is it fair or kind to use that word in that way. It has really only become taboo within the last few years.

Will memes suffer the same fate as vines?,"Vine is a company. TikTok took its place, and when that's gone something else will take its place.

Memes are an idea, not a company."
what’s wrong with me?,"My grandparents have raise me since a child and I can relate to this all too well. I have always had a fear of them dying. Not because I didn’t have anybody else to take care of me. But because they were and still are my rocks to this day.

My grandmother was my best friend. Truly not a single soul like here in this world. I use to stay up at night as a child just crying thinking about when they die and the day when it happiness. I spend almost 10 years laying I bed up at night thinking about things just like that.

It all really changed when I grew up and I had to start doing more things in like that adults have to get use to doing. She just passed away In March during the Corona pandemic and we were told we couldn’t bury her or give her a proper burial, yet they are military and they made an exception (grandfather is alive and was a war hero). 

I’m telling you, your brain changes completely every 6 months. At least for me. Remember to enjoy your life and not waste a second of it."
What happened here?,Dude don't think like that.. There 5 dudes in a big white van following you to potentially rob you and they probably asked you to roll down your window so they could threaten you with a gun. You acted very brave and cautiously by getting in your car and leaving. It was the right thing to do. Any other big dude may have gotten angry and gotten in a fight with them presumably ending up shot or attacked and left for dead.
why do people comment on their own post praising them without switching accounts?,"I dont know, great post though"
Why are protestors looting local shops?,"The protesters (or at least most of them) aren’t to blame. It’s the people that follow around with them just to loot local shops, it’s bull shit. They use George’s death to “justify” their crimes. It’s so stupid, but don’t blame the protesters, it’s the folks who tag along with them to steal, and destroy."
How Do I Tell My Dad It's Not 1950?!,"Hes saying this because when he was a child he spent his entire childhood outside. I get it that he doesn’t understand. But sitting at the computer for the whole day is not healthy I agree. Suggestion for you is to do a hobby outside. That’s the only activity you can do. Also, exercise. You can also try to convince your dad for your game time to be 5 hours instead of 3, 3 is a bit ridiculous."
"Has anyone else noticed the maze runner plot is basicly happening in real life? In the film they say, first the sun scorched the earth killing people in fires and famine, then came the virus with no cure... Australia's fires then covid-19?... its wierd no? Thoughts?","No.

We had like 2 or 3 apocalipsies this last decade and im still here eating chips and redditing"
"If a court calls an eyewitness up to the stand, and he is blind, is he still an eyewitness?",I thought he would be in a hearing.
Why do kamikaze pilots wear helmets?,Why do suicide bombers wear pants?
"My mom was likely murdered years ago, how do i find out who killed her?",I would assume the local police station at the place of the murder would allow you to access certain records. Maybe city officials at the time could help or yeah even sending into a cold case podcast could work. I feel like your best chance is to just find more information through sources of that time and area. I've never had to track down a killer but that would probably be the first place I'd start.

Let’s settle this… pineapple on pizza good or bad,We all have different tastes it’s good for me.
Why are people so over the top about anti-vaxxing? If they did genuine research they would know it just gave them antibodies to fight the disease. I guess I just don't understand their fight against something that is helpful and scientific?,"I realy dont know, my mom is anti-vaxxer, when i vaccinated she tought i would die, realy the fake information is completely ruining older people"
Is the cock pushup possible???,If you know... you know.
How do you guys control your horniness,Fap it out
What size is a whale urethra and do you think you can put your head inside?,I highly doubt your charming enough for a whale.
How long can I hold my pee before it becomes dangerous?,"Don't hold it too long - it can damage your kidneys and your bladder and raise the risk of UTI's. 

I was playing blackjack at a casino and there was a guy who had been at the table for over 10 hours, refusing to leave because he was on a hot streak (and he was - he hardly ever lost a hand in the first two hours I was there) and never even standing to stretch. His streak finally came to an end and when he stood up he just collapsed. After the dude is taken away, the dealer - who was so nonchalant about the whole thing - was like, yeah we see that all the time, bladder spasms are nothing to mess with. Streak or not, go pee."
Do you think picky eaters are ‘spoiled’?,"No. In the way you are describing it, absolutely not. Some people just don’t like certain foods and that’s fine. However, if someone refuses to eat perfectly good food that they like and are nit picking the little details(like it not being presented the way they want it to be), then I’d call that spoiled"
Am I the problem?,"No, you're not the problem. People just don't really appreciate you when they don't get what they want from you. Like what you said, you always get cheated on by guys who prefer ladies who are into more sexual stuff and what nots. On the other hand, when it comes to friends, I suggest that you should not consider any ""bestfriend"" of yours as a bestfriend. This might be a little confusing but learn that quality friendship is much better than a quantitative one. It doesn't matter if you have a few friends, what's important is they understand you, they trust you, and they are honest to you. You need to do the same to them as well. This is an advice coming from a 16 year old, I don't know if it would help that much but everything I said here right now are based on my own experience when it comes to relationships and friends :)"
Has anyone ever pretended to have a virus on their PC just so they can spam their friends with annoying stuff?,No but thanks for the idea
Do cats sense time?,"She doesn't own a watch, but a biological clock like all living beings. My cat goes for a very noisy poop every day at 8:20 a.m., which is really annoying on weekends (which obviously aren't displayed on his internal clock)."
Am I a Victim of Child Abuse?,"You are definitely the victim of child abuse, both verbal and physical. I'm so sorry you had to go through all of this, but i would absolutely seek help, or save up to move out as soon as you can. I almost cried reading what you had to endure. I want to give you a hug. I would reach out to a counselor and tell them your situation, and let them know that you are afraid that reaching out will make things worse. I am so sorry that you have to go through all this. If you ever need someone to talk to I'm here. Lots of love, hugs and support <3"
I was playing Xbox with my girl and this random guy joins the party and starts to talk to her ( he didn’t t know I was there)and she claims it’s her “friend” should I trust her?,"Kill him, na I'm joking but she may think there friends but the random guy might like her"
Surprised by your own wetness when horny?,"I’m male, but it’s similar with my girlfriend. Somehow this topic was discussed with a buddy of mine, and his girlfriend would also literally soak through layers of clothing, so not abnormal by any means."
What?,Who?
Why do i laugh or smile when something sad is going on and also why do i not take things seriously,"It’s a way to cope. Instead of feeling an overwhelming sadness or being angry, you cope with the bad situation by smiling and laughing."

Why do we have laws against shoplifting but no one enforces it?,"Most retail stores forbid employees from stopping shoplifters because if they or the thief get injured during an altercation, the store may be liable. Most employees are instructed to call the police.

On the other hand, I worked for Dollartree for a couple of years and our manager would take it personal when people would boost from the store.
Seen him confront shoplifters plenty of times to get our merchandise back. He gave zero shits about who it was. Even aware that upper management forbade what he was doing."

At 15, you can freelance (though it’ll take quite a while and you’ll need a skill you can sell), you can take surveys for money, and you miiiight be able to tutor.

I think r/careerguidance, r/beermoney, and r/beermoneyglobal would be able to answer your questions.

Hope this helped!

Edit: was looking at some articles talking about this and they also say you can sell some old stuff lying around online. Facebook Marketplace is usually popping, but you’d probably have a hard time meeting up, so this may not be ideal.

"If we aren't supposed to judge people by how they dress, why do some professions still have dress codes?","Well, my thing is is that even though we don’t or shouldn’t judge on what people wear I do think dress codes are important in professional situations. 
I understand we want to wear things that makes us comfortable, if we feel comfortable with boobs out then we should have the right to but save that for at home, or a night out or just a casual day.
If you’re a nurse or a doctor you have to wear scrubs, you’re not going to have your ass or boobs out. If you’re a chef you have to wear a chef coat, why? To keep you from burning yourself from the steam. 
You can be professional and still dress revealing however companies do have a set of standards to help provide guidance to their employees on what’s appropriate to wear. Dress codes can range from formal, to business, business casual or plain casual, just depends. 
Even though you like to be revealing, you can still dress sexy without being too revealing. Sometimes showing off your collarbones even a little shoulder is far more sexy than boobs (I even love boobs and have some pretty big knockers myself)  

I don’t think it’s because people judge (even though some really do) you just want to set an image regarding the image the company wants. 
I mean if you wanna start your own company and have your employees with tits out then hell yeah go for it! Its just what the company wants. :) I do see what you mean though, I’ve asked myself that question sometimes. So I’m just giving an opinion than an actual answer. :)"
Weird Thing I Do,"I mean i do pointless things like that and daydream a lot because of my adhd, its extremely bad and untreated at the moment lol so maybe talk to a doctor about it?"
At what point does a cult become a religion?,"One of the hallmarks of a cult is its insular nature.  Those who are within it are supposed to keep those outside of it at a distance (except to recruit new members).  I'm inclined to think that a cult is moving towards becoming a religion when the cult starts being something that is part of your life, not your whole life.  When they stop having rules about who you can be friends with, or what you can tell outsiders about your religion, that's when it's moving out of 'cult' country."
Why are people such assholes?,"Try putting yourself in their perspective. What they're doing is justified in their head. There's many ways and reasons one can argue that being a dickhead isn't actually being a dickhead.

Of course, I'm not condoning the behavior."
Please answer - for school,I was going to but I have no answers for it because I've never suffered from depression.
"Ok, so the definition of ""feminism"" is believing men and women are equal, so my question is like why do people call women that hate men ""feminists""? Because they are actually called femenatzis, so why dont we call them that?","That's what they call themselves, and most people don't pay close attention to what people say. Also the term ""feminazis"" was coined to make fun of these people and their baatardization of feminism.

The proper term would just be ""sexists"" or ""misandrists"""

Find pictures of real tits as well as tits from other hentais that are at the angle/position you want. Reference photos from both real breasts as well as drawn breasts will give you a good range of ideas for position, size, shading, etc etc

"{Serious} What's your ""I forgive you, but I didn't forget"" story?","2 years ago. After 4 years of not being interested in anyone I finally had a crush  on someone and I fell head-over-heals for her. My best friend said he would help me win her over. Bad idea. Turns out the motherfucker liked her too so he used the notion of helping me to start talking to her. Fast forward 2 months with him encouraging the living crap out of me that I was finally gonna get a gf and I should confess to her. She confessed that she liked him and not me. I was a trainwreck after that. To add insult to injury best friend rejected her even after He obviouslt flirted with her for 2 months. Took me a year to emotionally recover from that. To this day idk what the motherfucker was thinking. If he liked her he could've told me prior so i could move on without investing soo much shit for her (emotionally and physically) or he could've backed off since he was planning to reject her anyway! Presently me and the dude are still bros but when I need something delicate done I ask help from other people now.

You upvote my comment and I get a point. Then you find yourself addicted to the points and constantly have to check back to see if your score has changed and then we all become whores to the karma system.

How do I stop freezing up when a cat tries to sit on my lap?,"You just keep doing it anyway, assuming you know the cat is relatively well behaved. If they're trying to snuggle with you, they're likely sweethearts. Intellectually acknowledge that your anxiety is not justified. If you're interacting with a friend's cat, find that friend who trims their cat's nails. I'm a cat dude through and through, and I also get anxious hanging out with my friend's cat because they don't trim her nails. Not declawed, trimmed. 

If a cats nails have been trimmed and it's not a huge asshole, the scratch you would end up getting is minor. Better than a paper cut, at least. You wouldn't get that anxious handling paper, would you?"
hi everyone! what’s your favorite thing about yourself?,"I LOVE my hair. My whole childhood I wanted long hair, but my mom used to perm it not realizing it was damaging my hair and preventing it from growing. In 6th grade she stopped (she didn't have the time anymore) and got me braid ins so that I could keep a nice hair style for a longer period of time. My hair grew twice as long. I was so happy to see it grow more and more over the years. It's genuinely my favorite thing about me"
what happens when you dislike a youtube comment?,"\[Answer\]What \*actually\* happens is that when you sort comments on YT by best, the dislikes affect if you see it or not.

For example, if two comments have 100 likes (100 being the number displayed), but one has 50 dislikes and the other has no dislikes, the comment without dislikes will be seen first by viewers.

Sorry for any typos/grammatical errors. Hope this helped."
How does donating to charity help against Racism?,"Depends what you’re donating to. One of the major factors in reducing prejudices is exposure to different ethnicities. “Exposure” could be in the form of working alongside someone towards the same goal, supporting each other in a social support group (think religious groups or Alcoholics Anonymous etc), and so on. So if you’re donating to charities that run programs that mix and mingle people of different ethnicities then you are facilitating this process of destigmatization through exposure.

Does that make sense? I may have done a poor job explaining."

Does 0°C+0°C technically equal 64°F?,"You can't really apply addition to the concept of temperatures, unless you're using Kelvin, in which case 0 °C + 0 °C equals 523.67 °F.

Addition relies on ""zero"" being an absolute point, and all calculations are dependent on the variable's distance from zero. The problem is that with temperature zero is an arbitrary point, and it's a different point for C and F. Is there any logical reason why, when dealing with temperatures in the negative range, ""addition"" would result in things getting colder rather than warmer?"

"I’m a young engineer, recent graduate. I almost cried to my boss today over the phone today when she asked how I was doing.","Hey man, I'm sorry to hear you're having a tough time.  I'm an engineering manager and some people on my team are having a really similar situation as yourself.  I have a woman on my team who is 22 and joined the team in December.  She's really smart and really capable, but she is having a challenging time finding her groove in interpersonal relationships.  And worst of all is that she doesn't really see it as clearly as she would if we were in the office.  You don't get that ""let's walk to the coffee machine and shoot the shit"" stuff that compliments the professional relationship.  My guess is that the only time you talk to coworkers is when there's a specific question or deliverable.

My punchline is that I don't have a golden bullet for you.  For my team, I've tried setting up some happy hours (really helps when I set it up at like 3pm).  Yes, that cuts into the workday, but I get back far more than I put into it.  I try to encourage everyone to have their cameras on, grab a beer and talk about whatever they want.  As a manager, I try to prepare a couple of self-deprecating stories to get the juices flowing (like that time I messed up at my first job and caused a $60k tool to be scrapped or whatever).

For your specific situation, I'd talk to your boss (assuming her that she is also your technical lead) and ask for more check-ins throughout the week.  Going a week without any idea of feedback or how things are going is really tough!  I can sympathize.  If she's not your tech lead, talk to that person and see if you can get some periodic check-ins.  The first couple of times, come in with a couple ideas of things you felt you did well but ALSO a couple things you felt you did not do well.  Oftentimes, people are ultra confrontation-averse, and in these WFH times, every conversation is kind of confrontational by nature.  If you bring up a couple of things you think you could improve on, then that opens the door for your tech lead/boss to say, ""oh yeah, I guess you could have X, Y, or Z.  We typically do Y because blah blah blah.""  Or maybe bring in a task you completed and say, ""hey, could I run this by you, would you mind seeing if my head's on straight?""  Keep those meetings casual or else it'll be seen as a chore (both for you and them).  And don't feel like you're going to get meaningful feedback every chat.  You don't steer a ship every 5 seconds, after all.

Keep your head up.  It's tough right now, I know.  And your situation is exactly the one I told my company's leadership would be the toughest.  Young, eager engineers have nothing to soak up when they're sitting at home crunching numbers by themselves."
Who else loves talking with Machinists?,"I want to upvote this twice because it's so true. Not only does it help making/fixing things, but if your hobby is making things (3d printing, woodworking, garage machine shop) learning from those who do it every day is so valuable. Plus most machinists I've talked to are the most down to earth cool guys I've met."
The recruitment process for big companies is full of shit,"I got three scholarships from a large employer in my area. I never applied for the scholarships, they donate to the school, set them up, and just access student records and hand them out to who they think is the best. I got to go to a ceremony dinner in my (and other recipients honour), three years in a row and meet the president, some guys on the board, some hiring guys and introduce myself and ask them questions blah blah blah. Applied for a student internship, never heard back. Applied repeatedly, checked the box that asked “have you received a scholarship from
us?” Never even got a response. I work for their competitor now."
Hot take - most engineering jobs are not going to be very technical and probably don't need an engineering degree,I worked in R&D and still spent more time dealing with company bureaucracy than technical challenges.
How is McMaster so amazing?,"Not to mention having really good item filtering, tons of specs on all their parts, and CAD models of most of their products."
"Can we stop pushing masters on students still in school, recent grads, or those with little to no industry experience?","This is highly dependent on your field. For me my masters degree was very important in finding my 'niche'. Also, for my girlfriend's company they don't even hire people without masters degrees in her role."
What would the process of designing a whole factory full of processes like these?,"I'm not an IndE, but I would assume they would've started with the initial man-made process, and you optimize processes by adding different kinds of automation along the line until it becomes fully automated.

Then when the next factory is built they can use the automation from the first one and optimize the layout even more.

At that point it'll look like going from man made to automatic is sorcercy."
"Senior engineers only, how much do you bake?","5 of the senior engineers in my department have a cooking group, they meet every weekend and prepare 5 meals for the upcoming week, incl. some dessert.

So, they bake weekly, I suppose."
Some insight for everyone that believes the job market is trash for new engineers,"All depends on the sector... I work in packaged food manufacturing and business is booming, we've been hiring new grads this entire time."
What pressure would nacho cheese have to be at to cut through a 2x4?,"This is the kinda shit I subscribed to this subreddit for, not the monotony of job search questions."
"Is it just me, or has every company been just understaffed and overworked since 2008?",This thread is being locked due to rule breaking comments.
I hit a 15 year milestone as an engineering manager. AMA,"Could you talk through the early transition from individual contributor to supervisor? Anything you stumbled on or did particularly well at in the beginning? Also, how do you tailor your management style to your reports? Do you find that some aspects are universal, and some need to be customized?"
After 7 years I am finally getting my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering at 25. I feel like a failure.,"You’re giving it too much importance. I can guarantee that being upset with yourself over this will not move your career forward faster, and if you suffered mental health issues previously- it won’t help that either. You’re still a kid. You just accomplished a great thing. Be proud of yourself."
Are my parents full of it?,Do your thing. The world is changing.
"does anyone else hate when non engineers say ""you're an engineer you should know how [X] works""?","I was kicking around getting a T shirt made that says ""Mechanical engineer: I can't fix your car, I can't drive a train."""
Are you as an engineer annoyed that among the general public the word “technology” has started to refer almost exclusively to information technology?,[deleted]
Anyone else’s employer treating their employees like kids during this shutdown?,"Yeah. 

I’m a veteran at the work from home thing, as is my project manager, so I’ve got it pretty good.

The corporate crap is just people thinking they must do something.

Productivity is taking a hit because of children and spouses also being home. Everyone needs to settle into a new routine."
Does anyone else not prioritize their career?,"I feel it's important to understand what's important to you and prioritize. After being in the workforce for a few years, I've come the realization, what is within my ability is not necessarily within my time--I only have so many hours a day and have to prioritize what actually will get attention."

Reddit we need your help. Oppressive regime has cut off our internet (3G & Cable) from our region. Our people fear possible genocide as a result. Any ideas to restore or provide internet to some people in the region?,"Depending on how the internet access is shut (cable or cell), you might be able to break into and tunnel through an approved port/protocol.

You could set up local wifi points to accrete data (people's photos, stories, etc.) for a courier to transport on a flash drive to an area that isn't cut off."
"I think I'd like to be an engineer, but most engineers seem very depressed. What's the deal with that?","Maybe not depressed. It is easy to become cynical when you look at everything with a critical and sometimes overthinking eye. A big part of engineering is thinking about all the ways things might go wrong, no matter how small. Mitigating these issues for technical problems can make you a tremendous engineer. You can't mitigate every interpersonal or emotional issue though, and sometimes it would just be better if you didn't think about it."
Does anyone else feel like they have major knowledge gaps after graduating?,"It’s totally normal. As long as you can synthesize an answer to a problem on your own in a -reasonable- amount of time, it probably doesn’t matter if you can’t recall exactly what to do on the spot. Imagine you didn’t remember how to find max shear stresses in a beam due to transverse loading. The fact that you identified that missing info alone is a great start to just use a resource and recall what to do. Maybe it’s like riding a bike. You haven’t done it in a while, and maybe the first few seconds are shaky, but it’ll come right back. I feel this way after returning to school a few years later."
Company won't allow engineers to have LinkedIn profiles.,"I would love for them to try to enforce it. I would start working on an exit strategy.

You know what keeps other companies from poaching your people? Fucking compensation.

It would be very very hard for me to refrain from telling them to shove it right up their ass."
Does anyone have any idea how this works?,"It's a Zippo on a stick.

"Does anyone else purposefully incorporate the number ""69"" into their designs?","In Solidworks you can use any picture file to be what reflects back from the surface of a part in some of the display states. We had an engineer in our group that would use pictures of other engineers in the department as Easter eggs to find later. Even a few years after he's left, I'll still find pictures of myself on parts."
NPR recently ran a story on how plastics recycling is big PR scam. Can anyone from the recycling industry shed some light?,"Recycling is how manufacturers try to justify the immense cost savings that they get by using plastic.

Recycling plastic often uses similar (or even higher) amounts of energy as it did to create the products in the first place. There are byproducts, there is pollution, there is a hefty energy bill, and there is a lot of cost associated with logistics, sorting and processing. Ultimately, tax payers are footing the bill so that large companies can enjoy good publicity and low production cost.

One could argue it's not really that different from incinerating it, and probably far worse than just burying it, but it's a hard argument to substantiate due to the difficulty in objectively determining which type of pollution is most detrimental per unit plastic.

On the contamination side of things, I once walked by my neighbor's recycling bin, and they had purchased a rotisserie chicken, eaten it, left the carcass in the plastic container, and decided that they could recycle it like that. My faith in humanity took a pretty big hit that day. This level of negligence is the root of the contamination problem.

A tangent story for context: I also had a site visit from a supplier from Texas once (I'm in Canada) and he thought it was so cute that we have recycling bins. They took a picture. Recycling bins were so foreign to him, that it was a novelty worthy of taking a touristy photo.

The solution is to avoid using plastic the first time, so you don't have to figure out how to recycle it. Metal, glass and wood products should be favored. Reuse instead of recycling should be favored. Remember milk bottles?

Edit: added a word"
"The hardest part of learning anything, is knowing what to words to use in google. How do you quickly learn what you need to know in order to effectively google and get answers?",[deleted]
"My boss canceled our holiday break because I asked when a good time would be to take my vacation days, feeling down about my chances of having a career in our (small, incestuous) field","The other firms know your firm and your boss.  So?  I know plenty of people at competitors in my industry.  They are *competitors*.  They don't work for your boss.  In fact, if they can gracefully fuck over your boss, that works in their favor.  In other words... Gee, they hire you.  They get someone already familiar with the industry AND they fuck over the competition.  What's not to like?

And anytime someone tells you that ""it's terrible over there"" as a way to keep you?  Odds are that they're lying their ass off.  If it really was terrible their reaction would more likely be, ""Sure, go over there for a few months.  You'll be back."""
How do you turn off the “engineering brain”?,"They key is to solve the problem of problem solving in relationships, haha.

If I could grossly generalize, we engineers tend to think of time as a valuable asset.  Our solutions often center around saving time.  In relationships, though, being efficient with time is not necessary a priority.  In fact, I believe the best relationships are centered around how willing we are to be generous with our time, rather than efficient.

As an example, I have found that often when my wife is sharing a problem with me, she does not expect me to immediately voice options for solutions and start narrowing down the best one.  In fact, it's highly annoying to her even if she agrees with me.  I listen first, sympathize next, then ask questions.  If at that point I think I understand the problem enough to offer advice, I rarely tell her directly what I think she should do.  I ask her more questions that help her understand the options she may not have thought about.  

I think it's basically that not everyone shares a passion for fixing something quickly and moving on.  It's more about the journey, and it helps to be sensitive to that."
Is it okay to just think about your engineering job as an actual job that pays the bills but nothing more?,Yes
I want to quit my job but don't know if I morally can,"I'm not a professional so take my thoughts with a healthy dose of skeptisicm, but you sound both burned out and depressed. Maybe also guilty that you don't feel you can bring your all to work. It sounds like your SO is probably in a similar place.

I would consider therapy, I think it would help you a lot being able to talk through some of your concerns and grief (which it sounds like you have been pushing into the background and it's accumulating). I think it might give you some closure and help you decide on your direction.  Engineers like us rarely have a good work life balance to begin with so I don't think you're going to get what you need here. It sounds like you need someone to help you get back in tune with your emotional and mental needs and your relationship with your significant other before you make a decision.

Once you are in a better mental place you can consider leaving, being your own consultant, or maybe asking to switch to part time, I think. I would not make any big decisions right now just yet.

You mentioned your SO is failing to find a job. Even if you are comfortable financially is quitting your job going to put extra strain on your future plans and relationship?

Are you going to be just looking for a job again later if you could just have some time to decompress or grieve? Since you like engineering and you consider this a dream job, I think it makes more sense to keep it and consider what you need to do to get yourself in a healthier place outside of work. Based on my limited information, you sounds like you need a vacation or at least a weekend without thinking about work.

If you did leave can you imagine finding a new job that makes you satisfied that has the same supportive managers? It sounds like no, but you probably could. Do you do anything but mechanical engineering, are you tired of the subject matter? Do you have any hobbies or activities that you can do to recharge, like going hiking,  reading a book, or a creative outlet that calms you? Have you been anywhere but your house in the last few months? Are you overworked and maybe your work needs to hire another person to help you? Are you really providing a low quality of work, or is that maybe the harsh inner voice of self criticism?

You don't actually have to answer any of these questions, but I hope maybe they can help you pinpoint what's making you miserable or making you feel like you need to escape.

Regardless, you should discuss alternatives and plan with your employer for what they will do WHEN you go on a longer vacation where you won't be working. This is important, because you  obviously need a break and everyone should get a longer vacation at times whether it be for births, funerals, or traveling. Also, schedule a vacation! Right now! It can be two or even five months from now, paid or unpaid, doesn't matter. This will give your employer a really clear chance to figure things out without you needing to say you're considering leaving. Make sure it's a least a week, and while you're on vacation do not turn on your phone until the beginning or end of the day to check work messages, if you check them at all."
Anyone else start doing better in their later years of college (like jr sr year) even though it suppossed to he harder?,"I certainly got better, but I think it had more to do with ""learning how to learn"", if that makes any sense. Basically getting better at knowing the best way to study and getting better at note taking. I was someone who coasted through highschool and had the rude awakening in college where you actually have to take notes and study for tests, which I didn't have to do before."
"Engineers, what are some things people tell you about engineering that are not true? What bad advice have you heard before?","Perhaps an unpopular opinion here, but I don’t think “Just get your company to pay for a masters degree!” is universally great advice. First off, going back to school while working is *hard*. I know a number of people who started out doing that and ended up either quitting to focus on the degree full time or dropping out of the grad program to focus on work. It’s certainly not impossible, but I think it’s more of a challenge than many people realize, especially after you’ve had a few years to settle into post-school work/life balance. Also, many companies will only pay for some portion of the degree, so it’s not guaranteed that you’ll get through the program entirely on the company’s dime. 

Now that’s not to say that it’s still not the right choice for plenty of folks, but it seems like the reddit hivemind thinks that everyone can just go work for a company for a few years, get them to pay for an MS while working, and then get that sexy R&D or design job and start raking in the cash easy peasy. It’s often a lot more complicated and challenging than presented on reddit, imo.

Edit: a good point that I forgot to mention is it becomes a lot easier if you can negotiate to go part-time or half-time while doing the masters, but that also often comes with a corresponding cut in pay you’ll need to account for."
Professor here. How can I make your new hires more useful?,"Probably not the answer you’re looking for, but most of these folks who complain about new hires have a fundamental misunderstanding about what the purpose of college is.

Engineering school is about learning the fundamentals while getting broad exposure to all sorts of topics both inside and outside engineering. This is a good approach because it makes for well rounded students who have a foundation to do great things. The problem is that you simply aren’t going to be able to squeeze anything into your 2/3/4 credit class that’s going to impress the salty engineer who’s been doing that specialized thing every day for twenty years. Nor should you.

I think the best you can do is to always keep it close to real world applications, and don’t force your research down your undergrads’ throats."
How About a Monthly r/AskEngineers Challenge ?,[deleted]
Engineering seems more like Project Management than Engineering sometimes.,"I heard it put this way:

What's your favorite Excel function?,"INDEX.  Super helpful when linking tables.  Similar to VLOOKUP, I’ve just had less issues using it.

I use this primarily to grab data points associated with specific data points on the sheet I’m working on.  E.g. widget A, it’s color, width, whatever. When the tables get big it’s really nice so that you don’t spend so much time trying to manually match each of these values."

3 Job Offers rescinded in 1 year,"Two questions come to mind:  
1) Are you sure there is nothing in your background check that would trip you up? (drug use, social media posts, etc...)?   


if you are sure the answer to #1 is absolutely not, then:  
2) Were these job offers perhaps with defense industry companies? I ask because many defense industry companies initially hire for a specific contract, often prior to that contracts award, in order to ""staff up"" with the expectation they will win the contract.

My best advice is any engineering industry can be like this. It is more about how the companies value your time. From my experience EU based companies value your time more and will put more effort into training you during work hours. 

My current position is in manufacturing for a safety company based out of the EU. We are not supposed to work beyond 40 hours, get X dollars per year for training and can use up to 10 working days for it, and 4 weeks vacation start.  The insurance is mediocre though at best. This applies to a lot of benefits but our EU counter parts will not take calls outside of work hours and this has driven the US employees to do the same (well demand the same)."

What’s the point of MATLAB?,"Training. You can get corporate training or assistance on problems from Mathworks directly. Python has people who do training but it's not first party really. Also Mathworks is the defacto standard in schools. It's what everyone teaches so everyone has some level of competence at it. 

Toolboxes. You can get a toolbox that does the important things you need. No need to fuss around with libraries which may be dated. Which may be poorly documented. Nearly everything in matlab has code examples and documentation. It helps you get to a base level of competence faster. 

It's very flexible. Generate a couple graph. Done. Compile some stand alone code. Done. Parse hundreds of logs across hundreds of directories. Done. These are just some examples of things I've done (or coworkers) in the last year or two with matlab. 

Software. Matlab comes from a single company. Python is a language. You need to pick an IDE which can pose issues if you don't have admin rights or restrictive access controls on software. I know a colleague had issues with python IDEs and packages getting approved through our IT folks. 

Legacy. Plenty of companies have complex toolchains with matlab, simulink or something else. They've spent hundreds if not thousands of man hours developing the models and tools. Refactoring is painful especially on things that are exquisite where only a few people truly understand what's happening under the hood.

**TL;DR:** If this would fit in a TLDR, you wouldn't need me to explain it.  Cliff Notes: Shared Access Physical Mediums.

----

> I understand, at a very high level, that computers send information in packets over lines or the air.

At a very high level, yes.  It's both a little more complicated than that and a little less complicated than that depending on how you look at it.  I'll try to break it down.

**Fair warning:** I'm going to pick apart your wording a little bit.  It's not because I'm trying to beat you up, its just that, especially in communications, terms get thrown around a lot that add to a lot of confusion.  There are some words that, if you know exactly what it means, it means something exactly (like ""packets""), and if you don't, it just confuses everybody else that also doesn't quite know what exactly it means.  So please don't take it personally.  I'll start with ""packets"". When you're talking a physical medium of ""lines"" or ""air"", they're called ""frames.""  Also, ixnay on the ""lines"" (unqualified) noun.  That means so many different things to so many different people that it causes problems...""cables"" is cool though.

There's a bit of some back story I'm going to have to go through, so try to stay with me--I promise it'll be worth it.  I'm going to have to go through a couple things so that I can explain things better.  Those are going to be:

* The OSI Physical Layer
* Shared Access Mediums
* What a Modem is and isn't
* Bands, channels, and bandwidth
* Multiplexing
* And finally, **how it all works together.** AKA, the Fun Stuff.

> I'm just asking about physical cables.

I know.  It's complicated.  Let's take a walk.  I'm going to hit you with a bunch of theory and then tie it all together with some real-world stuff.

----

# The Physical Layer #

Ok, let's start with a couple of things.  In communication, there's a model called the [OSI Layer Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model), which basically is a conceptual division of the separation of functions involved in communication.

You see, not too long ago, every hardware engineer realized that if they had to implement, from scratch, every single communication protocol in every device, that it would be an impossible task to maintain.  So they broke up the functional nature of communication.  If you know anything even remotely technical about the internet, you'll have heard of TCP/IP, which fits into the OSI model, however TCP/IP was out before the OSI model had been developed and it fits into there quite horribly in some ways.  Still, you can see the layering in there.

At the bottom of this model is what's called the Physical Layer, which is basically where the magic starts to happen--and is, for the most part, the most complicated.  Different physical mediums have different advantages, challenges, drawbacks, exploitable characteristics, etc.  There are standards bodies such as [IEEE](http://ieee.org) and [TIA/EIA](http://www.tiaonline.org) that sit down and cook up the standards for how to transmit data on any given physical medium.  There's no magic behind Wifi or DSL, or any of that.  A bunch of engineers sat down, wrote up a standard, and said, ""here, if you want to make cable modems, this is how it has to behave.""  Ever heard of 802.11 (Wifi)?  That's an IEEE standard.

The reason I'm running this all down is just to say this: It's the physical layer's job to get a stream of bits from one computers memory into another computers memory.  There's a better explanation than that, but that one works and is the least complicated.  From there, you start going up the model.  It's beyond this explanation how the whole model works, but the next step up is called the data-link layer, which is essentially where ""ok, the physical layer got a series of bits into my memory, what do they mean? What does the first 8 bits mean?  The next 16?""  Up from there is the Network layer, which is where ""Packets"" come into existence (see, I told you).

So at the end of the day, essentially any physical medium that you can conceivably transmit data on can be layered into a communications channel--and in fact is.  From traditional telephone lines to coaxial television cables to radio frequencies to power transmission lines to highly precisely manufactured Ethernet cables to fiber optics... each is a physical medium that can be used to transmit data.  Some are more complicated than others.

----
#Ok, so why'd I go through all that trouble explaining the physical layer?#

The physical layer is where the magic happens, and can be quite complicated depending on the medium.  Fiber optics?  You're blinking a laser on and off really quickly.  Cable modem--now that shit's complicated, but I'll explain it.

But here's the real reason why.  If you run a physical wire between two computers, it's obviously rather simple to send bits back and forth.  You can do it with a single wire, and decide what voltage is a `1` and what voltage is a `0`, and how quickly they will be sent, and you have a communications channel.  But it's impractical (in fact, impossible) to run a physical connection between every pair of computers on the internet.  The flip side of that is called a ""shared medium"", meaning one where you're not the only sender/recipient.  Shared mediums allow cable companies to reach thousands of people with just a few physical cables in the ground.  They allow mobile telephone operators to serve millions of people with just a handful of radio towers.  They allow your sister to watch netflix why you ~~try yet in vain for another decade to find pictures of Keri Russell naked~~ do your homework.

Shared mediums is where it's at, but, as your questions bring up, this is a complicated subject.  So let's get started:

> Is it like a signal for a processor where there's a threshold, like 3.3V (just an example) that causes a gate to close?

We're going to drop the word ""signal"" from our vocabulary for a little bit.  You don't know what it means--which is fine, because nobody can agree on what it exactly means, which is why nobody uses it as a bare word like that.

In a processor--or any other hardware for that matter--you have a physical layer and a protocol to follow.  If you want to design a Digital Canooter Valve, you go buy a Canooter Valve controller chip, read up on which pin does what and how you tell it to do what you want it to do (physical protocol), and... do it.

So yes, it's like ""a threshold that causes a gate to close"", which is a 1-wire serial communication channel, but it's also not like that in many cases.  That's just one physical medium, and one physical protocol.

While we're taking a small break, let me answer a couple things and clear up a few others.

> These packets contain identifying information for whatever device is looking for it, like an IP address, domain name to find, or whatever.

Ok, you're getting WAY ahead of yourself though.  Remember that OSI model?  We've gotten to layer 2.  You're talking about Layer 7.  We'll get there.

> I'm guessing that these requests and packets of information have to be turned into bits somehow.

Yep, and now you know how--kind of.  I'll get into the (some) of the rest of the OSI model at the end so you understand it better.  But once you have a stream of bits, now you have to put it on the wire (or the air), and that's the physical layer's job.

----
#Shared Access Mediums#

So now we have a rough idea of what a transmission medium is.  What OP is asking about is what's called a ""shared access"" medium.  That's any transmission medium where there are more than one sender and/or recipient.

So, starting to get to the first couple of OP's questions, yes, every shared access medium has to handle the the problem of whose data is whose, when who can transmit and when who can't, what happens when two senders talk over each other, etc, etc.  This is a HUGE subject--rooms full of books have been written on it, but I'll touch on just a couple here before getting into Modems and then putting it all together.

But essentially, when you're dealing with shared access media, you have to deal with how to separate traffic in a meaningful way so that everybody gets a reasonably fair share, and how to deal with the situations where there might be some confusion about things.  **This is the point I want to make here: A bunch of engineers sat down and decided what the answers were going to be to all of your questions ahead of time because you have all of those same problems on every shared medium.**

So, as an example, the original version of Ethernet was essentially a bunch of computers clamped onto what essentially amounted to radio antenna cable.  So remember those IEEE guys?  Yeah, they designed all this next stuff:  Any station could start transmitting at any time, provided no other station was transmitting.  There is a mechanism to deal with two stations talking over each other in the event that two stations started transmitting at the same time (called a collision) where one station could signal the other station (or a third could do it) that the two were transmitting over each other.  Each station would stop transmitting and pick a random amount of time to delay before re-attempting the transmission and, with any luck, you got through on the second try.  Yes, everybody got a copy of everybody else's traffic.  As you can see, this only scales so well, but that's how that worked.  Most of this technology is still in use today although in practice, collisions over wired ethernet are a thing of the past (but still very real over wifi) and the rest is at MUCH higher speeds.

Advice needed: what is the best way to tell new engineer to just sit back and listen without trying to come up with solutions to problems he doesn't understand yet?,"I’ll go a different direction. His creative thinking may just end up helping you down the road, and suggesting he stop talking and listen now will stifle that and demotivate him or make him want to leave. But explaining and answering his questions puts the burden on you and that’s no good either. I’d suggest thinking like a coach/teacher: maybe have him do the homework and research to answer his own questions. Next time he comes up with a solution that won’t work, say: “That’s an interesting thought. Why don’t you flesh it out over the weekend, write it down, do some calculations, and pitch it to me next week.” That slows him down without shutting him down, and if there’s a truly good idea in there somewhere maybe he will find it."
How does this 3 axis gyro type housing work?,"My guess is there is a single motor in the base that simply rotates and is programmed to stop at a given point. Notice the brand name on the base spinning and stopping, and the visible gap between the spinning platter and the outer housing in the black base. The innermost gimbal has an extra arch which has a single linkage attached to the rotating base. On a well balanced mechanism, this linkage could just be a piece of string, it doesn't have much load, it just has to describe a particular movement. As the base rotates in a circle this loose linkage pulls the rest of the rest of the gimbals around in whatever configuration is required to adopt the pose. Consider this [frame](https://imgur.com/lftVNHr) where the watch is facing away. The two inner gimbals are lined up at a 45d angle, similar to the final pose, but because the outer gimbal is obviously fixed it is perfectly perpendicular to them. another 180d rotation and the inner gimbals are in their final pose.

Lastly notice the inner gimbals move in sine waves 90d from each other. The middle gimbal tracks only up and down, while the inner most tracks left and right. It makes sense that in a full revolution both gimbals move in sine wave like fashions, back and forth, when this is literally how sine and cosine are defined from a unit circle."

"I recently saw a picture of a wave slamming into a lighthouse. We’ve all witnessed the destructive power of water, so how are lighthouses able to withstand these impacts over its lifespan?","Offshore lighthouses are pretty strongly built. The stone sections aren't just joined with mortar, but often have mechanical interactions such as dovetails and pins holding them together.

They're also typically built on rocky outcrops that are normally above high water level or at least close to it, which take the brunt of the wave force and help redirect the water."
"If 70 to 80 % of the people are not satisfied, why aren't things changing?","The others...sometimes it is the people you need to work with or the company organization that makes it miserable.

More engineering jobs that I've found have 0 room for upward mobility within the department/company/etc. So the hope to be well rewarded for strong work performance over the long term isn't there.

I am happy to be an engineer, but I have accepted that if I want to see any meaningful reward for my work I need to jump ship. Maybe come back later when I can apply for jobs way above my original position.

My experience is with the US job market. I can't say this is true for all others but this is my experience. I have found reward as an engineer by applying it to projects I do outside of work for myself of local community. It offsets the feeling of jumping around glass ceilings."

"Current engineers, how did you beat the arrogance?","Remember you aren't talking to engineers, you're talking to freshman university students who think they're the smartest people in the room because they've likely never been challenged intellectually in their lives. Most people lose that before they hit the workforce, or shortly afterwards."
Why is it so difficult to get a job as an engineer out of college?,"Yeah they say there's a shortage of engineers but what they mean is experienced engineers (3-5+ years of experience). There's a huge surplus of young engineers right out of college; universities are cranking them out by the thousands every semester.  

It takes 6 months to a year for a new engineer to start producing profitable work so a lot of companies are reluctant to put in that investment. 

You either have to have something lined up before you graduate or you spend months of pure hell applying to literally any company willing to give you a shot. I was unfortunate to have had to go the hard route, but my persistence paid off in the end. None of it was easy by any sense of the word.

The encouraging fact, though, is that it can be done, even without family connections. Especially if you maintain a high GPA, get internships and co-ops every possible occasion and score a full time job before graduation.

Is it worth it? If you have a passion for it, absolutely. That's up to you to decide."
For the engineers here whose parents are NOT engineers . . . what do you (did you) wish they knew about your engineering journey?,"Neither of my parents are engineers or even went to college. 

Beyond college, I think my parents think the work I do comes easy when it is very challenging. I have tried to explain some of the things I do (project management, design work, FEA, prototyping, customer presentations, etc) but because they have never done some of those engineering involved activities it is hard to explain how much effort is involved and they assume I make A LOT of money for what I do when I think I am underpaid (working on promotion though)."

What habits and choices did you make as a young engineer to develop your skills to become a competent and successful engineer?,"Note-taking, executive presence during meetings, curiosity, and high personal standard of quality for my work."
Is it okay to not want to be an engineering manager?,"No one is going to think you lack ambition. There are two paths you can take, management or technical. Staying on the technical path involves going the senior engineer, lead, etc. route. There's nothing wrong with that. So yes, it's totally OK."
"So I took the $18/hr ""Mechanical Engineering"" job in NYC... (UPDATE)","I hate to say it but welcome to the work field. You have to keep in mind that to the company you are basically a child. A lot of companies hire grads because they have the foundation to learn how the company does things. Not because they believe you can do things currently. You will most likely be doing grunt work for the first 6months to a year until you show them you aren't just someone that might slow them down.

This is not to mention that pay. Like $18/hr seems like engineering technician pay, and bad at that. let alone in NYC. Is it a small company? There used to be a running joke when I was in school to work as an electrician that the engineers with stamps only do the trade long enough to get the stamp and then basically retire because they can just sit in an office and make $2500 a pop. Being in the engineering field now I see that there's a lot more to it than that, but there are plenty of stamp and go companies out there.

I'd say keep an ear to the ground about other places hiring. If you are there for less than 6months than it's not worth putting on your resume anyways and you'd never need to have any future employers contact them anyways. Most engineering firms that I'm familiar with are petty and don't like competition, so they often don't talk to anyone from those other firms anyways."
Has anyone noticed that job postings are lowballing the hell out of the position they are hiring for?,"Its a bit of both. I'm in the same job struggle. I'm used to just searching job types and salaries now to determine what my worth would be for a given job.   


The issue I am seeing is that companies are having 0-3 years experience jobs getting applications from people with 5+ years because they need the work. So it behooves the company to take the same job, increase the minimum experience, and keep the same pay. They still get a role filled for a lower cost, but gain a worker that has the experience.  


I say this as a fresh grad with limited experience getting beat out in multiple 2nd interviews with the HR manager telling me it was only experience difference. So take my experience/opinion with a grain of salt."

AP Calc and linear algebra lessons through the likes of youtube and Khan Academy will do you well for a refresher, as that is typically the level of mathematics they would expect you to be reasonably proficient in coming into the program.

Finally, age doesnt really matter imo, nobody will judge you for it, and it should have no bearing on your application (except for the fact that your highschool transcripts may not be accepted at this point).

Is planned obsolescence a thing where you work?,"Planned obsolescence does not exist in the form it's commonly portrayed. Nobody is asking an engineer ""make this thing so it will fail sooner"".

The difference is that people ARE saying ""make this thing as cheap as possible. It needs to last 2 years."" And then the engineer says ""Okay here's a design. It'll last 2 years. For an extra dollar of material, I can make it last 10 years"", but then because they have competitors in the market, they need to make their product as cheap as possible, so they don't shell out for longevity.

Nobody tries to make things break sooner, but because of other priorities coming ahead of lifespan, lifespan suffers.

This ultimately comes to consumer choice. If you're out buying a new washing machine for your clothes, and there's a $500 option and a $2000 option, you're far, far more likely to go with the 500, even if the 2000 will last 10 times as long. People are cost-averse more than anything. And when you buy the 500, it's going to have plastic gears instead of metal gears. It's going to have lower quality electronic components. It's going to have a motor that will burn out after a few years. Unfortunately the companies have kind of been forced into making products lower quality to meet the lower price demands of consumers."

I get that it feels like simple rejection to you, but they used a great deal of their company resources vetting you as a potential employee and gave you a tour of their facility. It sounds like you were close to an offer but they likely had to pick between you and a few others. There could be a variety of reasons why they selected the other candidate, but it could have been as simple as the hiring manager had to make a decision and did so.

Dont get defeated, we're in unprecedented times right now but engineering is always going to be needed. It will be quite hard getting hired on currently as most engineers who can work from home are working from home. That means there may not be someone in the office to train you, so they are likely going to hold off on hiring at the moment.

One recommendation I would have (if it would be of interest to you) is to get more hands on related experience to the job you are pursuing. If you're a mechanical engineer, get a job working in a fabrication shop to learn the building side of things. This will make you a far more valuable design / mechanical engineer."

2.) Structural Engineer, BS, MS, PE, SE who grinded out 20 years at a structural firm for average pay. Found a niche as an expert in forensic engineering and got tapped to run a company specializing in this around age 45-50. The company sold, and rumor has it his equity was also around $10M.

That's where the min years of experience come from.

Try applying for a large company, they are usually more willing to invest in fresh grad but they usually hire from top tier college or local college...

Otherwise, aim for a related job that doesn't require the years of experience....

Mid-Senior Engineers: What are the biggest weakness you notice in entry-level applicants and new-hires?,"New hires - not speaking up when they don't understand.  I'm not thrilled that many organizations don't have a good structure to train a new hire but that's reality.  I am happy to answer questions, and will set up regular tag ups to discuss. However on more than one occasion they say they understand the task, and then I find out later they spent a week or two twiddling their thumbs because they didn't know what to do.  I'm also learning to ask better questions to make sure they understand, but please, just ask!

And I get it, I was also nervous to ask a question.  But at the end of the day, everyone's life is easier if I know when you don't understand a task or what the next step is.  

Also, from a very frustrating experience, when I assign you a task, even if its boring, don't ask if the intern can do it instead.  I know its boring.  No one likes tracing requirements.  But the intern had other stuff, and at my level sometimes I still have to trace requirements, so don't act like you are above it because you have a masters and have been working there for 3 months."

"Before CAD and FEA, did engineers use very rigorous math in their daily jobs?","You know how everyone complains that ""They don't build 'em like they used to""?

Well, the reason old stuff was super durable was because it was constantly overbuilt because it was easier to slightly over-build the product then to spend tons of time and money optimizing every little component for it's purpose. They also had a lot less data about actual in-use load cases. So they might have to assume that a particular structure will see 10 kN of load for a million cycles instead of the 2 kN for 650,000 cycles that it will actually see. Nowadays it's easier and cheaper to collect more detailed load data, and use that to optimize a product for it's actual expected life and duty cycle.

Long story short, there was a lot more rule-of-thumb and ""10 tons capacity oughta be enough"" engineering on relatively non-critical components, whereas today even minor components will get more detailed calculation, virtual testing, physical testing, and design iteration. Also notice that older stuff is often based on simple components that can be easily and accurately approximated as simple beams, or cylindrical pressure vessels, or other textbook examples. This is the physics/engineering joke ""first, assume the cow is spherical"" in action.

There were certainly products and applications where the detailed math was done at great effort and expense, but that was reserved for stuff where it was truly critical to have it optimized to a specific operating condition."

Why is it more effective to hop jobs these days than stay in one place?,"One thing i don't see anyone else talking about is that you are likely increasing in value faster than your pay is increasing. Especially if you started at a place straight out of college, odds are you are massively more useful two or three years later than you were when you started. Look at job postings that list salaries (sadly pretty rare) and you'll see a 15% or more increase after just a few years. But a company with typical yearly raises will probably only increase your salary 2-3% a year. They're not evaluating you based on your actual value, but a new company is."
"For Engineers that lived through the 2008 crash, how difficult will it be to find an entry level engineering job in the next couple of years?","To be as much of a realist as possible:

No one knows what's about to happen. You will be competing for positions against people with years of experience but there will be entry level positions that the laid off engineers won't qualify for.

Things will still need to get made and coding can still be done at a distance. You're probably better off than most because your education/skills means you can do your job on a PC mostly.

At this point, there's nothing you can do other than just apply and try and sell yourself. There's no magic formula or previous data to go off of. This is unlike anything we've seen before and anyone who says they know what's gonna happen is lying or talking mad shit."
Is the Masters Degree becoming the new “Bachelors Degree” in engineering?,"On the other end of a spectrum a good friend of mine, sharp gal, got her MS in Aero from a school with a strong program and works at a well-established company - her take: ""Yeah that was a waste, should have just gone straight into industry.""

Personally I find that a Master's degree is roughly equivalent to a year or so of industry experience. About the same time frame, learn/grow the same amount, just a question of which environment you prefer. Especially once you get a few years out of school I think the difference between BS and MS is even further diminished and your career portfolio is vastly more important.

PhD is a different story and is a clear step above BS/MS. Though with that said, I find that PhD's have polarizing reputations in industry. Some are super sharp and great to have onboard. Others are near useless and impractical."
I feel like I’ve forgotten everything I learned since I graduated a few years ago. Terrified after working in an unrelated industry for a year.,"To tell you the truth, engineering is so broad even if you were working in engineering you'd probably be forgetting everything you learned about areas of engineering you're not working in. Thats my personal experience any. For example if working in a design role you might not go anywhere near fluid dynamics for years but having done the basics for your degree you should pick it up fairly quickly if you need to relearn it.

Almost any engineering role will require you to learn stuff you haven't covered at degree anyway so having to brush up on some technical stuff that you haven't touched in a while shouldn't be a problem!"

These other 120 hours worth of things will not be addressed in any manner. 

Document it at the beginning of every week. And clearly state what regulatory items will not be in compliance because the work is not being completed. 

And when people start asking about it, you make it very clear: We don't have the manpower to cover everything you want covered. If you want that thing covered, something else is not going to get done. 

Be very clear: there are not enough hours in the day or the week for you to get everything done, so something is not going to get done. Given that circumstance, you are going to pick what isn't going to get done (and is going to fail). And be clear on that point as well. Focus manpower on making sure a couple of things stay completely afloat and couple of things don't. Don't go for the ""try to juggle everything"" approach because everything is going to sink. 

And they are going to scream to high heaven that *all of this needs to be done*. And you are going to keep replying: Given the manpower, it isn't going to happen.

And everything you know! They ask you things like, what time is it and you immediately know which device provided that information and how to use such device. Magic!  You can read and write EVERY word that they can think off! You can do math in your head! See? it is not hard at all, it’s just experienced. I have it, you don’t. But you will!"

There are great people and average people in every position. When I worked in industry there was no way to know who had a PhD without checking their LinkedIn.

I don't mention I'm doing a PhD most of the time because people get really weird about it - like combative or defensive. Like they need to put you down for researching something you're interested in."
How do I move past being the engineer that fills in the cracks?,"> I've spoken to my supervisors and they've basically said ""Well you're good at what you do, none of us are organized or good communicators or patient enough to do that"".  

You've pigeonholed yourself or at least allowed yourself to be pigeonholed. You need to push back on this. ""I'm only good at this stuff because I force myself to be good at it, and I wanted to help the team. I don't enjoy it and I don't want to be the one doing everyone's grunt work, I'm not the secretary."" You should be a blunt about it as you think your supervisors can take. 

Next time you get someone giving you their shit work, tell them you don't have time now and request that they take care of it themselves. This may not be popular, and they'll be forced to either do it themselves, or they'll take it up with your boss who will either tell them to do their own grunt work or your boss will tell you that the grunt work **is** your job. By forcing the issue. you'll find out if you're a peer or the water boy.

You may find out that your only real solution is to leave and not make the same mistake again."

New hire is making $10k more than than most engineers in same position,"Yeah, that's a thing that's happening. 

That's ultimatum-time for the existing employees. Meet up with the other engineers there in your place of work. All of you should ask for a raise in keeping with your experience. And you should also all be prepared to walk if you don't get it. 

This is workplace organizing. You all need to be on the same page when you confront management about this. 

&#x200B;

It's happening a lot of places. I'm asking for a raise in my position much for the same reason, but it's much harder for me to organize my workplace. Fortunately, several other engineers on my level have come to the same conclusion and will be asking for raises. UNfortunately, my company only gets a set amount of budget for raises, and that has to be distributed to everyone who 'deserves' them. So it's not really labor-friendly."

Of course, what sort of work you do will depend on the company and team you're supporting."

Young Female Engineer Dealing with Misogynistic Clients,"Whew. I had a young female engineer working for me at one point in time that went through similar issues. It was even as bad as certain employees basically ignoring her in meetings and waiting for male engineers to say the same exact thing before they would respond. It was probably one of the hardest management challenges I've ever had to deal with, but it can be managed. 

First, and most importantly, you need to sit down and have a serious conversation with your boss. You need to be very specific about what makes you uncomfortable. One thing I found from my above challenge was that as ""open minded"" as I thought I was, I was actually missing more than a few inappropriate interactions. Once you've done this, it's time for him to do his job as a professional and shut that down with the clients, especially since he has a relationship with them. 

Second, once you have this discussion, and you're happy that your boss is going to do the right thing, I'd suggest being patient for a bit to give him an opportunity to do so. I wouldn't expect change overnight, but it's a great chance for him to build a strong relationship with you by doing his job. 

Third, and maybe this one should be higher, you should never feel unable to voice your discomfort in any situation. As for the ""hands on"" thing, I have a couple of prior peers that did this to basically everyone, male or female, so be aware that they may genuinely not have any idea that it makes you uncomfortable. Hopefully your boss helps with this, but I'd also suggest that if you're comfortable, you also reinforce very clearly where your boundaries are. 

Finally, if all else fails, find a new job. I hate to give this as a step, especially since it's no guarantee that you won't be fighting the same thing at the next place you land. 

Sorry for the long reply. This hits a bit personally for me."

How many of you could pass a university level differential equation class?,"I graduated nearly 20years ago. I’ve worked for nearly 19years as an Engineer and can confidently say its not just differentiation equations exams that I would fail now. I can remember the concepts of most of the stuff I learned at Uni, but the detail needed to pass an exam? No way. I remember Aircraft Stability and Control, that there is stick-free and stick-fixed and different oscillating conditions, but I don’t remember a single equation out of the 100 or so that I had to learn for the exam. I remember Otto and Diesel cycles from Thermo, but if you gave me an example to work out right now I’d be stuck at the first step. 

Point is, I don’t need to remember it all in exam conditions as I have text books/internet at hand and it’s unlikely my work are going to give me a problem that I need to solve where I’m not allowed books or to talk to people!

Have you ever regretted becoming an engineer?,"I don't. I love seeing and analyzing the world through a different lense. Seeing all the meticulous details that go into making something safe and operable.

Having an engineering degree can take you anywhere from banking, hospital management, design to teaching. There are some people I know indirectly with an Engineering degree and they became brew masters at a craft brewery (and they can make a good brew) .

Having an engineering degree is valued for its problem solving, critical thinking and bridge between natural and theoretical sciences."
"Experienced tradesmen vs ""booksmart"" engineers","While I heartily agree with beckerc73’s comment above about always listen to the guys doing the actual work, if you want the other side... 

I’m in a conservative industry.  We fear change. But many is the time when the tradesman has angrily said “I’ve been doing it that way for 20 years!”   And I had to find a polite way to tell them they’d been doing it wrong for 20 years.  

Occasionally the person doing the work doesn’t have the opportunity to see the long term effect of their actions.  They find the fastest way to build/install something and move on to next job. 

But they don’t see the warrantee repairs that come back.  Or the fixes that have to be made in the field 15 years later.  So if you’ve got good science behind you and can explain the ramifications, sometimes you can drag them along."

Engineer working too slow,"Think about what your time is spent on. I feel I spend too much time researching ideas and being indecisive myself.

I've spent hours and hours googling stuff for my personal projects (which sounds like you may have an issue like that). Sometimes it's better to spend a long time thinking about how to do something, but sometimes it's better to just pick an idea and stick to it.

How do you climb the corporate ladder the quickest as an engineer? And is it worth it?,"I've been at this awhile and played the game.  I was a young engineer and made front line manager before I was 30.  Here's a few of the things that I learned the hard way.

You must always advocate for yourself.  No one else will do it for you.  Now there's a million ways to do it, and company culture will dictate a lot of it, but never assume someone else has your best interests in mind.  Part of this is learning to play politics.  To many people in my career were proud to profess ""I don't play politics"" only to be sidelined.  Games get played with or without your consent, don't be passive.

You're an engineer, you bring a skill set that others don't.  I was always ruthless and meticulous at bringing the facts to light.  I earned the reputation of having all my facts in order once by screwing over a director from another department when he tried to screw me over in a meeting.  After that hard earned reputation was won, I did everything I could to maintain it.

You will never have enough time, or ability to do everything.  Become a master at dropping bullshit and picking what's important over what's pressing.  People will love to misdirect you and waste your time, so get just as good at saying no as saying yes.

Finally, in today's day an age the ability to grow in a single company is mostly a dead idea.  Balance your career and set goals.  If you aren't making those goals at one company?  Move.  You should be prepared to move to other parts of the country too.

Finally, read, read, read.  You should be reading lots of books on everything from sales, negotiation, to workflow ideas.  Always sharpen the saw.

You can have a balanced personal life and work life.  There will be some points where you need to put one over the other, but in the end if you build your life right, you'll make that choice, not others.

Edit to add:  A couple of people have asked the same or similar questions.

Books?  There's so many I've read, but a few to start are:

* 7 habits of highly successful people
* Never Split the Difference 
* 48 laws of power
* The 4 hour work week
* How to win friends and influence people

In general with books, don't be afraid to read anything.  I've had epiphanies reading about late 1920's monetary policy.  

A couple of people have asked about office politics.  Here's the key take away.  You can be Machiavelli, or you can be Cincinnatus.  The most important thing to understand?  How the game is played.  Even if you want to chill, be a good worker, and keep your head below the fray you need to understand that the games of power will get played.  I've seen people who picked the wrong mentor, failed to see what was going on and went down with the ship when their mentor crashed and burned."

Engineers who improved their communication skills over the course of their careers: what tips do you have for a struggling new engineer?,"Slow down the conversation, don't be afraid to take a moment to collect your thoughts before expressing them.

Slow down your actual speech and think more about each word, it tends to make you sound more experienced and not slow/dumb.

Preparation is key, go over possible conversations in your mind before you have them.

Tell the other person you have some thoughts about the topic and you will get back to them a bit later after collecting them.

Buy yourself some time, ask things like ""what makes you say that"" and get the other person talking again, while you think of what to say."
Dealing with over confidence in new engineers. New grads that are 3 weeks into the job.,"I mean a 400 page tech manual probably isn’t something I’m gonna sit down and read cover to cover at work.  Now I will read chapters that are relevant to my current task.

"If an engineer becomes aware of a serious problem with a building, are they required to report it to the authorities if the owner ignores the report?","Let’s say you’re an engineer that has discovered a major structural flaw in a high-rise condominium building. 

You report that flaw to the building owner. 

Now… the building owner has to make a decision… fix the issue, or hope for the best. 

What is the engineer’s responsibility at this point? He has reported his findings. The engineer likely didn’t include in his report any language that says “the building is fine”, or “the building will fail”. There are rarely any absolutes in engineering reports (at least of this nature), because no one can predict exactly what will happen. 

But, the engineer (hopefully) said something along the lines of “failure to correct this condition could possibly lead to a catastrophic failure”. It’s weasel wording, but it covers the engineer. The owness is now on the building owner to either make the repairs - or stick his thumb up his rectum. 

The owner (who is naïve to structural engineering issues) may claim the engineer wasn’t clear on the dangers of the building collapsing. Which is exactly why an engineer needs to provide written documentation on observations like this. If the engineer can show in his report that he portrayed the situation as best as they observed, and expressed concerns within the report, he should be free of liability. 

It sounds like in this particular case that the owner was going to make the necessary changes to fix the building. But, even that can’t be done instantly after receiving the engineer’s report. It takes time and money to repair major structural issues in buildings. 

In a condominium- these repairs are sometimes funded by the residents living in the building. Special assessments need to be funded to pay for this. It’s likely the “owner” of the building wasn’t any single person or corporation, but rather a Condominium Association Board of Trustees who likely employs a management company to take care of issues that arise. For their sake, I hope they passed along the concerns of the engineer that did the initial assessment to the occupants of the building. 

Whatever the outcome of this scenario, it’s going to be interesting to see how it all plays out in litigation. With potentially 150+ families dead, there is going to be a hunt to find a responsible party."

"How common is it for various companies, industries, etc. to throw young, entry-level engineers right in and say “Do work. Good luck!” i.e., not provide them a lot of mentorship?","It's more common than you might think. If you haven't figured out yet (you soon will), engineering is something you learn by doing, not by going to class or reading or watching YouTube videos. So yeah, a lot of young engineers get thrown into the deep end of the pool and told to swim. The lucky ones have a mentor watching them splash around until they decide it's time to throw a life saver.

The important thing is that you have some notes and whatever to go on, and your current supervisor thinks you're doing good work, so keep it up.

Don't be afraid to keep asking questions. Sounds to me like you're on the right track."
What should I do if I I have nothing to do at an internship?,"I used to try and ""make up"" work. Even if another engineer has already made or done some of the stuff below it's a good exercise and you can check against it.

-If it's a manufacturing facility you can try an do some data analysis for cp/cpk and distributions of part parameters. 

-If you have FEA software try simulating stress/heat on a design 

-Make some kind of excel calculator for a parameter they care about

-Learn python and write a script to crunch and plot test data

Those are what I did at internships when I was bored out of my mind.

Even if the final result isn't super useful it's a good exercise, it shows initiative, and you can put it on your resume(and you can pretend it was more useful than it was)"
Why does Boeing struggle to find good engineers in the US?,"When I graduated in the late 1990's, one of my classmates got a job with Boeing in Seattle. They were supposed to reimburse him for his relocation costs etc. So he rents a U-haul, loads up his stuff, moves from Michigan to the Seattle area, rents an apartment and starts furnishing it. 

Shows up for his first day and no one has any idea he's supposed to be there. After a lot of phone calls and confusion, it turns out they'd cancelled the program he was supposed to work on, and he didn't really have a job at all. They'd just forgotten to let him know."
Why do managers get paid disproportionately more?,"I would say that varies by company.  I work for a very large engineering company and make more than my manager.  We basically have two paths of management: ""engineering managers"" and ""technical leads"".  Engineering managers are by functional group (hardware, software, etc) and handle the ""HR"" aspects (manpower planning, performance reviews, part of allocating resources to projects).  Technical leads are those people actually responsible for technical execution of a project.  Usually the technical leads make more or on the same footing as the first level of managers.  Above that, there are some technical slots that go up to director level equivalents (but not many)."

"Automotive Engineers, how has your real world work experience affected your car purchase selection?","Some experience, not vast experience.American/major European/Major Japanese brands are all pretty similar. They will each have their quirks, their ""why haven't they addressed this issue yet, it's been 3 model years.""

Ultimately, what I keep in mind is this: Stronger, faster, lighter, cheaper. We (the engineers of the world as a collective) are constantly trying new things and sprinkling in new fairy dust trying to do one of those 4 things. If we get one to work without negatively affecting the other 4- hell yeah, grand slam! Most of the time it's a trade-off. However, over the year we've developed new materials, new practices, new industrial applications. We have more control at greater precision than even a decade ago. We once controlled a cold-headed tie-rod with overall length of 327 mm to within 0.7 mm while respecting internally related critical dimensions. They were asking for control at 0.5mm. We went round and round with them trying to make this work tighter and tighter, without increasing their cost to produce (time, material cost/too much scrap, those sorts of things). Eventually we'd hit a wall and said... look guys, what does this thing even fit into that you need that level of precision on this particular piece. We can do it, but it's going to be a re-cost (reevaluation of cost to manufacture), and you're not going to like it.

Many of the people that do the actual work of manufacturing your car are not particularly bright. Many are dumb, or do REALLY dumb things. Many will not read the instructions, specifically new instructions because ""we've always done it this way"". Well, Fred, that way killed someone, now we're doing it this way. Some intentionally mess up so they can have another break while the engineering team attempts to figure out what happened or to mess up another shift.

There are controls in place that are supposed to prevent this, but your controls are only as strong as the human enforcing them. I once saw a person check a part with a ""go/no-go"" set up, the part fail, and they put it in the good bin anyway. In before you come at me about automated setups for checks, yup... they're better, but they're still controlled by humans at the end of the day. Humans mess up: program things incorrectly, misinterpret signals or data, don't think things through, or any number of other things. Sensors can fail

Is it just me or are HR personnel incompetent at the most trial of tasks?,"Recruiting for an AV/acoustics consulting position. HR gave me resumes whose primary experience was in car stereos. Yes, HR can often have a huge disconnect from the nature of the work.

Handling benefits, timesheets, etc, usually competent and effective. Recruiting...hit or miss. Hosting training and development sessions...also often hit or miss...getting IT to fix a bad printer, upgrade a WAN link to other offices, bring fiber into our office, they carry a big stick and bring results quickly for issues that staff have identified are getting in the way of productivity.

At my company, I know at least a couple directors of large groups including those on the board of directors that loathe HR and see them as a necessary evil. Sometimes it's actual incompetence but mostly it's a breakdown in communications. But the problem with HR is that they run full speed ahead so a breakdown in communications spirals out of control quickly rather than having the good sense to stop and ask for directions."
Explain engineering to a 13yo,"Making a pulley system for him to hoist himself could be fun. 

Forget about the math for now. At this point, ""that didn't work, should we try making it longer or shorter"" type of questions during your experiments to keep them engaged."
Do you take a lunch break/eat lunch at work?,"Fuck that, if you work better after eating, then eat. Don't succumb to that type of peer pressure.  I'd understand being upset with you if they told you you had half an hour for lunch and you took an hour every single day, but that doesn't sound like the case. 

They're probably just stressed out and taking it out on you through sideways comments in team meetings. If it's a problem, try bringing it up with the person complaining in private and ask if there's a better time for you to eat. But when someone makes comments like that about decent employees at work, I assume the person making the comment is the asshat, not the person taking lunch. If that really is something they will hold against you, look for other jobs, the eventual burnout at that place won't be worth it."

Help. I just completed my degree in aerospace engineering with a 2.68/4.0 gpa am I doomed as an engineer. I had 3 D’s some B’s and some C’s and I had trouble of panicking and not remembering staff during exams and I don’t think anyone could ever hire me. Any advice,Your first job will likely be the only job that cares about your GPA. Experience trumps grades very quickly. Make sure you know the material you are saying you do when you apply for a job or at the very least be honest during the interview if you don't know something. Prepare to discuss your GPA during the interview. The excuse you gave in your headline will probably cause some concern for the interviewer as it would be an indicator for how you react in stressful situations. I would suggest coming up with a different way to explain that.

Do you also recognize the engineering career path cycle?,"If you are having these feelings one thing that I can absolutely vouch for is that climbing the corporate ladder will not make them go away! A traditional career is unlikely to ever be the thing that gives your life meaning, and the kind of person who does derive their meaning from corporate success is unlikely to be somebody who thinks deeply about finding meaning anyway.

So I guess the only strategies I can reccomend are to either learn to not give a fuck (tough one I know) or to do something else.

Why are other companies designing new ventilators rather than just getting license to manufacture per existing designs?,">Andy Slavitt’s Saturday tweet: He says he had a chat with the CEO of Medtronic (a major ventilator manufacturer). They have gone from 300/week of their big machine to get to 1000/week by June but a major issue is the machines have 765 unique parts many of which have low inventory levels. To solve it they have roped in NASA/JPL to get to work re-engineering to reduce parts to scale. Because of the inventory problems in making enough ventilators fast enough they decided to start up a “pandemic machine” which is lower cost, faster & easier to produce and have made a radical decision to put the plans online so others can produce them, also throwing in consulting and distribution for free too. The CEO also said they took their lowest price they had ever sold the product for & made that the fixed price.

"If I took a latest generation CPU back in time to 1990 and showed their respective manufacturers. To what extent could the technology be reverse engineered by looking at the final product? and what aspects would have to wait until 2021, regardless of them knowing the end product 21 years in advance?","Careful, that's how Skynet and the Terminators came about...

Serious answer from a semiconductor engineer active since 1994:

First you have to conceive it, then you have to figure out how to make it, then you have to make it scale to be production worthy.

In the early 90's, most companies were pushing down to critical dimensions (CD—the smallest feature of a chip die) of 1 micron (µm = 10^-6 meters) or below. Note that a human hair can vary from roughly 20-200 µm in diameter. Our R&D dry plasma etch equipment was consistently producing CDs of 0.15µm or below, but making that production worthy was really pushing the technology limits of the time, specifically in computing power to run the vacuum, gas flow, plasma, RF, and magnetic systems while adjusting all the interconnected process parameters in real time while maintaining sufficient die yields (the percentage of chips on a wafer substrate that actually work as intended).

And that was just the etch step, as the technology for deposition of metallic and non-conductive layers and especially photolithography was also struggling to maintain ever-shrinking CDs. Eventually, semiconductor equipment manufacturers learned how to produce consistently down into the nanometer range (nm = 10^-9 meters).

These days, advanced foundries are producing at 5nm, and pushing down to 3 nm or below. Note: in these cases ""nm"" refers more to the technology node and less about specific critical dimensions. At these small nodes, we're struggling with quantum tunneling effects through the gate oxide layers where one ""circuit"" can ""leak"" and affect nearby circuits. And photolithography to create these ever-shrinking masks is also struggling with wavelength issues as the light interacts with itself and causes interference that muddies the results.

So now, we're looking not smaller, but taller. Advanced 3D NAND memory cells are being produced by effectively stacking circuits on top of each other to fit more cores into the same wafer space. Think of the difference between a bunch of suburban houses with large yards, moving to townhouses sharing walls, to apartment buildings with multiple floors. Smaller and taller to fit more people or circuits into ever-shrinking real estate.

And leading-edge processors like Apple's M1 chips are achieving huge efficiency gains by integrating tens of billions of transistors to create CPU, GPU, and memory all on the same silicon wafer die so things simply work faster while using less power. Take your apartment building and make it cover the entire block, with shops, utilities, libraries, parks, restaurants, and office space all integrated into the same building so you can sell the car and just take the elevator to anything you need.
 
So if you showed me an advanced chip from today back in 1990-ish, I'd stick it in an electron microscope and be amazed at the technology, but it'd be pretty hard to build a 15-floor brick building when we're still building timber-framed single story houses.

But it would absolutely show what is theoretically possible, and get people thinking in new directions and pushing the technology to get there sooner, hopefully while avoiding the inevitable AI uprising and global nuclear extermination..."

"I'm still in my undergraduate studies for Electrical Engineering, but I feel like I know absolutely nothing. How did you feel when you graduated?

They might give you more responsibility based on your experience but they know they will need to train you. I'm a recent graduate (last year) and I shadow senior engineers. I get to do a lot of paperwork to learn company processes, and review engineering drawings to become familiar with components. Some friends of mine were given smaller projects to work on with other new hires, others are even given jobs to help define requirements. 

Overall don't stress, University is meant to give you the background and show that you can handle the workload. Depending on your employer college coursework might be harder than your actual job. I know a ton of people who said the same thing as you before graduating, including myself, and we are all now doing fine working as engineers.

Am I too old?,"Well you are not too old. An engineering degree will take you around 4 to 5 years to complete. At 46 you are definitely not old to get into the industry. Companies don’t care about age but do care about skills. As long as your skills allow the company to make profits, that’s all that matter; so while pursuing this degree you should do everything you can to do some internships, and get the skills necessary to be a successful engineer. also, bear in mind that the degree that you will be pursuing must ABET accredited. As long as it’s ABET accredited you will be fine. Like I said companies care about your skills and what you can do. I doubt that you can do an engineering degree online since engineering programs always have some type of lab works and projects that you have to complete. So, make sure it’s a ABET accredited program. Regarding salaries it varies a lot depending on your location and experience. But, don’t expect to make $96k right out of university. Usually, starting salaries for engineers are around $60k - $70k. With sufficient experience you’ll eventually get to $96k. You can look at this link from the US Bureau of labor and statistic. You will get a broad idea of what electrical engineering is. (Salary, job outlook, expectations etc...)

Just dissolved my credit card in acetone. Why is the antenna in this pattern? Why not just a rectangle?,"Antenna engineer here. It's because it has to be that way for the NFC to work. You obviously can't put a little computer on the card because it would be too big and require too much power. These NFC systems (which use RFID protocols) use something called modulated backscatter. In its simplest form, the scanner hits the cards with a signal (usually at 13.56 MHz). The card is able to convert some of this energy and use it to power a single, tiny switch in the middle of the antenna. When the switch is in one position (usually open but it can depend) you basically have two antennas both reflecting the signal back to the scanner; think of this as transmitting a 1. When the switch closes, the currents on the antenna behave such that instead of two antennas, you have one antenna where the currents on the two half antennas from earlier are 180 degrees out of phase so their reflections actually cancel each other out and no energy (or at least significantly less energy) makes it back to the scanner. Think of this as transmitting a zero (fixed in edit). Thats the basic idea and how RFID and NFC let passive devices with no external power ""transmit"" information. If you want to know more, there are tons of resources and videos explaining in detail. Just search RFID and modulated backscatter.

Edit(s): fixed a typo where I said the case of phase cancelling also transmitted a one.

I should also clarify that I am very much over simplifying a lot of things. There are active systems that do include some sort of embedded computers and cryptography functions that are inductively powered and these are becoming more and more common as computing power becomes cheaper, smaller, and more powerful. I made those assumptions to set the stage for a very simple motivation for the cheap version of modulated backscatter. 

Thanks to those who pointed out issue with the original explanation."

Did you or your team ever make a bad hire before? How bad were they?,"I was working on a small team, working on PCB's and embedded firmware. The senior guy left, and we were looking for another senior guy. In comes ""Bob"" who has a long resume, has been a CTO at a startup, and when asked ""how much of that project did you do?"" generally responds ""all of it"". For a small company where ""all of it"" is the norm, we thought that was right in line. Bob chit chats with the managers of different departments, and he starts working.

Bob was supposed to help with a current project, and expand code that did ""get\_valueA()"" with ""get\_valueB()"". First week of work, Bob's code won't compile. I go over and point out that his header file is missing, and he responds ""I'm pretty sure the header file is optional"". OK.. little rusty on code, we'll work on that, I guess.

During a PCB review, Bob not only reviews the PCB, but just starts moving things and re-routing. More or less ""just because"" - no real reason. In one relatively critical circuit, Bob insists I don't know what I'm doing and adds a diode. Turns out he put that diode in the wrong place, so it actually defeats the purpose of the circuit... that's frustrating, but we all make mistakes, I guess.

Months go on, and Bob spends most of his time messing around, getting frustrated, or changing things without any real justification. At one point, the software team has a come to Jesus meeting with him, because he needs constant hand-holding to use our version control software, and it turns out his code expansion project not only added ""get\_valueB()"", but changed the entire paradigm that we read values in code. We went from get\_value() returning a value, to all functions referencing common arrays at the same time.. for no real reason. Now we're starting to get the picture that Bob may not have the competence he suggested.

Later, I go to a trade show and meet one of Bob's old coworkers who \*actually\* wrote all of the code at his start-up. It's now very apparent that when Bob says he ""did all of it"" he really means he ""told other people what to do and claimed he did all of it"". To be fair to Bob, I don't think he was lying.. he honestly thought he did all of it. Unfortunately we didn't do a good job of checking on what that meant

Eventually, after constantly taking up others time and causing endless frustration, Bob was let go. Personally, I have several lessons learned (TL;DR):

1. It's difficult to hire senior engineers while giving them homework or tests. Having been on both ends, it's VERY difficult to pull off without frustrating someone in the process. A good compromise is - during the interview process - have the applicant use your software and do something straightforward. Add a diode to this design, change this function to do something different, etc. It's much more practical than a paper test, and much less complicated than coordinating a take-home project.
2. If someone says they ""did all of it"" when talking about a project, you should be making a note to follow up during the background/ reference check. If we had actually followed up with Bob's coworkers about what he did on projects, we could have saved ourselves months of headache and a senior engineer's salary. At the very least you have a better understanding of what that person's skills are versus what they think they are.
3. Seriously connect what the applicant's day-to-day work and expectations will be with the interview. If you're not sure what the applicant will do day to day, you owe it to yourself to clarify that. Sure, ask questions about fundamentals and how you handle adversity, but don't let that distract from seeing how well this person will fit into your day-to-day work flow."

Why are American engineers paid so much more than their European & Asian counterparts?,"

I've been interested in this for a while. The general consensus I gathered from this sub over the years is that the US has: "" *Higher living cost, way higher college debt, way higher health insurance cost, way lower mandatory pension payments, almost no payments for social plans and worker protections for when you get fired/I'll. No mandatory vacation days, no unlimited sick days, and often unpaid overtime. As well as way lower taxes"".*

This all means the base salary has and can be higher which mainly benefits you if you are a healthy go-getter, young person. The overal **average** quality of living, when you are an engineer seems about the same for the US and EU though. When you perform well above average and put in the extra effort, the US will definetly reward you more. 

One thing that really stands out, is how I run into 10x more Europeans when abroad in Asia or South America, compared to US citizens. Besides the large population of the US. They just don't seem to have time for vacations."
"I work in a shop and mainly do oil changes, tires, and lights. Why does it seem like vehicles (especially newer ones) have countermeasures against maintenance?","Maintenance isn't a priority.

In 15 years of experience, I haven't necessarily seen any PhDs get paid significantly more. Instead, they get the opportunity to work on exactly what they want to work on. Granted, yes, a lot of top positions have PhDs but that's all built on a long career before that. 

I may be an outlier though, because at my company, master's degrees and PhDs are treated very similarly: you're expected to be a world expert in your field no matter your education."
Team lead de-anonymized anonymous survey.,"That sucks, unfortunately the golden rule of anonymous workplace surveys is: assume they are not anonymous.

If you had that much to complain about, polishing the resume while the job market is this good is probably the right move anyway.

Probably this won't blow back immediately. If you're a good worker and give results this isn't the type of thing you'll get fired over. But consciously or subconsciously it's the type of thing that affects reviews, raises, bonuses, etc so it is more likely to hurt you long term if you stay."

* Shut off far too quickly and are hard to reactivate.  Maybe because after my  hands have cold water on them a passive IR sensor doesn't trigger.

* Have very low flow, at at level that might be ok if the water stayed on long enough but makes it really hard to wash well when you only get a few seconds of flow.

What should I do?,"Before you do anything, think about exactly WHY you turned them down before.  If that hasn't changed, is it really worth pursuing this position at all?  Yeah you have more bargaining power, but if the negatives remain then the negatives remain.  

This is almost like getting back together with an ex-GF.  If you broke it off for a really good reason, don't let a little make-up sex change your mind because in the end things will just turn ugly again."

2.3 GPA general education,"Put it out of your mind, and let something else take it's place. Talk about projects you've done, things you've built, design / build mistakes you've made & lessons learned, etc...

Make it so there's _plenty_ to talk about outside of your GPA. And even that discussion can be: yes, I have ADHD and generally find some difficulties with the classroom environment, but that doesn't hold me back from doing X, where X is something someone wants to pay you to do.

And: if you don't already, start designing and building your own stuff! Doesn't have to be fancy."
Starting to think about retirement after working as an engineer since 1984. What are the long term expectations?,"> I know I need to go

Heh.  You remind me of a former (now retired) colleague of mine.  His last 2-3 years his mantra was, ""I gotsta go.  I'm old, gray, and in the way!""

That said... Don't be my father.  He did about 50 years as an engineer.  He retired because his wife more or less demanded that he do so.  But he had no hobbies.  Once he retired?  Sure, they went on cruises and such but his life lost meaning.  He ate a bullet about 2 years after he retired.  Whatever it is, find your post-retirement purpose."

Why do people think engineers make obscene amounts of money?,"There are a few reasons I think.  First, the difference in starting pay is quite different.  At least in my area, starting pay below 55k for an ME would be insulting and not even looked at.  Second, the extremes are different.  An engineer in the right time and place, as an employee, can make 150k+.  I’ve got coworkers who when only 12 years into their career were at 125k.  

All of that summarizes to the average - in general, engineers will be paid more.  Sure a really skilled pipe fitter can make a ton of money.  But an average engineer can make the same.  "
"Engineers who started a company, how did you start and how did you know it was the time to do it?","Licensed civil here. I personally have not started my own firm but I have done some independent work that I could have turned into my own firm. I literally just emailed local firms and asked if they had any work that I could help with when I had some spare time. You might be surprised how many firms are just slammed and would like to be able to refer work. So many times a client comes to them and wants something done and they just don't have the manpower to do it. 

Once you have done a project or two for a firm they will typically steer work your way so long as you do a decent job and communicate effectively with them. Eventually clients will come directly to you and boom you have your own firm."
For those that conduct interviews - what are some interesting questions you've been asked by the candidate at the end of the interview?,"Any questions about the company direction and how that specific sector or team can play a role is good (probably best at a mid level and above Interview).

"Engineers who started their own engineering business/founded a startup with others , what is your story ? Was it worth it?","Instead of working for other idiots, I decided I'd be the idiot and others would work for me.

So, I would go for Python."

Are entry level engineers screwed regarding the COVID scare and how it could effect the hiring process?,I’m really sorry man. I was in grad school during the Dot Bomb in 2001 and a lot of my friends had their offers canceled. It sucked.
"My sons love science and mechanical everything, I/we are afraid of the math they will have to learn to become engineers, how can I can prepare them, or ease their minds?","At that level, math is a skill you develop. It's its own language, so it's difficult for most, you just have to give it time.

There will be tons of resources at University, namely office hours with the professor and/or TA, math tutors (at least my school had some for each math class), and the vast expanse of YouTube, Khan academy, and other free online resources.

For now as they finish up in the public school system, the best thing they can do in my opinion is prioritize good work/study ethic over mastering algebra and geometry."

"During layoffs in an engineering company, which ones are the first to go?","Manager here who's been through this a few times... here's how it works if the company knows a layoff is coming, and they almost always do a few months ahead of time. 

These things often seem out of the blue and rushed to employees who aren't paying a lot of attention to the bottom line, but managers and upper managers will tell you that in big companies these things get a TON of attention and planning. First, your senior execs will see you're not likely to make your next quarter's numbers and the forecast isn't better beyond that. They'll make a decision to basically prepare for a layoff. Accountants start running numbers. There's always a big up-front cost of laying people off in severance pay, at least with professional office type positions where people are seldom ""laid off"" as much as ""let go"" and aren't going to get a call-back in a few months if things turn around.

The first step from the engineering org's standpoint is that all of the managers and directors will get a request from HR and their bosses to force rank their employees. You'll often be asked to rank them in a couple ways. By performance, by potential, by criticality of their assignments. These may be weighted and combined, and at some point you have a final list. Every employee in your group ranked from highest to lowest. The weighting is probably 80+% based on performance in my experience. I as a manager may be in on a calibration meeting with my boss to combine my list with the other managers, I may not and he may do it himself. Either way, every budgeting org or group will have a combined list. 

The GM's, VP's, and other senior executives will at some point make a decision about what percentage of the headcount needs to be let go. Usually these things need CEO approval, maybe even Board of Directors approval. From my understanding often they'll give a general approval and leave the finer details to the people closer to each business. Most companies won't do a layoff for less than 8-10% of headcount unless they're really big. They'll instead cancel any open reqs, cancel travel, cease 401k matching, force everyone to take an unpaid week off, or get much more strict on low-performers.  

So the decision to lay people off is made and a target dollar amount of monthly salary or a percentage of the workforce is decided upon. Next the senior execs balance those numbers from department to department. Typically R&D will get a bit lighter pass than manufacturing and manufacturing support roles. If you're not making stuff you don't need people in manufacturing roles. Of course, if they decide to cancel an entire project or program R&D could be hit harder. So maybe the company decides to shed 10% of total headcount, and there's a percentage by group. Accounting will shed 10%, IT 12%, Marketing  8%, Purchasing 10%, R&D 8%, Operations 15%, etc. These numbers tend to be tentative until the very last days and they'll have a few scenarios. 

Before you find out as a manager who's actually going to be laid off, HR and Legal will review the lists. They'll make sure that your forced ranking didn't single out the women in the department, the minorities, the near-retirees, etc. In a few rare cases I've seen people who should have been in the bottom list kept because they fit into a protected group or were considered likely to sue. (You can't lay off the woman who's 7 months pregnant without the threat of getting sued. You can't lay off the guy who's 63 and your department's only African American employee without the threat of getting sued.) Like it or not, the HR/Legal contribution here is to protect the company from litigation. 

A day or two before the official layoff as a manager you'll get your list of people affected. You pretty much expected one head, you're hoping you don't lose two or three. You see it's only one. Sigh of relief. You also get your instructions on how and when it should be handled. You've known this may come for months, you've hoped the market would get better and there wouldn't be a layoff. You'll feel like shit and won't eat. You've dropped some hints to your group a few times that numbers weren't great and nobody should be making big financial decisions. For some reason the same dumbass you're about to lay off who never worked as hard as he could have went out and bought a new truck last month anyways. You like him as a person but he's the right guy to lay off if you have to let someone go. 

So to answer you initial question, the first people to go are contractors, but most companies don't even consider letting contractors go a layoff. If you're getting to a ""real"" layoff the contractors are probably already gone. The next group to go is everyone on a PIP (performance improvement plan) or who was on one in the last year. Then it tends to focus on people in manufacturing and support roles like IT and accounting. Sales, R&D, and Marketing in my experience tend to get less cutting. More than anything though, it's low performers. The company will always say it isn't, but only an idiot would lay off their best people. It's why people laid off have such a hard time getting another job.

"Ex-SpaceX (or other wild startups), where are you now?","I worked for an intense startup right after grad school. It wasn’t high profile like SpaceX but we developed the first single chip 10G optical Ethernet transceiver. It was hard. Basically six or seven days a week for months on end. Dinner every night at the office. Insane pressure. 

I started out as one of the first employees. Got what I thought was a lot of stock. Turns out there is this thing called dilution so every time they did another funding round I owned less and less. Ended up getting essentially nothing when they were finally bought (like 15 years after founding). 

I burned out big time and got physically ill after a couple of years. The whole analog design team quit after about two years. 

I went to a big chip supplier for a few years and now I am at a big defense place. Much happier now. Don’t make a ton of money compared to my ex classmates at Apple, Microsoft, Qualcomm, or Broadcom, but I work mostly 40 hour weeks now and only rarely work on the weekend. 

I wouldn’t do the startup again, but it did make me a better engineer. I learned tons during two years in the fire. I also got my name on a few influential papers and patents so that is good too. 

If I were doing it all over again I would probably try a big company to start.

Edit: typos. And I should have known better about the stock options. My bad."
"Would you consider your engineering job ""hard"" when compared to 4 years of college?","Hard in a different way.

Academic assignments are vetted to make sure they define all the criteria.  Work is like ""please make this thing as strong as possible ASAP and really cheaply"".... and then 6 weeks later they add.... ""and fit in this confined space... and be corrosion resistant... and meet these government regulations..."".   Then you find out the thing you designed is heavier than your shop's overhead crane capacity and a vendor quoted the project without understanding the specifications.   And then that supplier goes bankrupt but your critical subcomponents are locked inside their building and you have to wait for the courts to decide who owns them.   and then you have to rebuy them back from the supplier's creditors.  Finally the thing gets built and shipped, but is damaged in route, so you fly to a third world country to assess the damage.  When you get there you find a family of migrants living in the cargo container."
How many of you guys are actually passionate about your work vs just collecting a paycheck?,"I used to love my job. I’m very passionate about the work we do. I took a bit of a wrong step a few months back and said yes, instead of no. As a result, I’m currently collecting a paycheck. Hoping for it to go away soon."
I’ve been calculating something completely wrong for over a year at my job.,"Always fess up. 1st major project I had as a Mfg. Engineer, I dropped a specially configured testing HMI panel 20ft off a pallet rack when moving another pallet rack while during a layout change. Called my boss and gave him a heads up, then got some help from our testing team to see the damage. Somehow the HMI was perfectly fine, just had to replace the panel/enclosure and some wiring, so I got the replacement parts ordered all before getting with my boss face to face. I was shitting bricks the whole walk to his office, thought I was going to get fired for sure.

Boss basically said ""lol I've done way worse when I was an ME, be careful next time."""
"engineers, what are the biggest things about the reality of working in engineering that surprised you or maybe wasn’t talked about enough/at all before you entered the industry?","I got to do technical stuff for about 2 years before I was put into program management.

Senior engineers: how do you organize yourself so that you won‘t burn out at work?,"Don’t take work home, be well compensated for your work and performance. You will put a bit more effort into work if it earns you a 10-20k bonus and go home smiling after a long day.



It’s not totally common, but you can reach a point where you have no real concern over finances on a daily basis. That is a pretty nice feeling and it lets you focus on work challenges."
"Manufacturing Engineers, how do you stay sane?","It highly depends on what you like to do.  I'm fueled by a fast paced environment.  Also, remember that you shouldn't sweat the little things and work as much as you're comfortable with.  The more experience you get, the easier things become.

It took me 10 years to stop putting everything into my job and realizing they didn't care about me.  I wouldn't take anything back as the value of what I learned has helped me immensely when I decided to slow down.  I still go at a fast pace compared to my colleagues, but it's a much more manageable pace for me in the long term."
How can a Milwaukee handheld drill make 750 ft-lb of torque when most cars don’t even make 300?,"It's the impact mechanism.  The 750 ft-lb is a peak torque that can briefly occur during impacts, not a sustained torque.  Think about it, you'd never be able to hold by hand a drill outputting sustained torque that high."
"My supervisor left the company, which by default made me the new department head. This came with an increased work load on top of leading a project that will heavily shape the future of the company. There hasn't been a single mention of a raise. Should I ask for the raise? What if they say no?","If you deliver the product, and ask for the raise, what's to say they don't dump you because they have what they wanted?

Ask for the raise now, and if they don't come through, leave. They don't deserve to exist if they don't pay their workers."
Why are so many engineers adverse to careers in manufacturing?,"The manufacturing engineers that I've worked with tend to get boxed in with excessive constraints. 

There's pressure from management to make the factory work faster/cheaper.

The average line manager gets twitchy and irritable if anything delays a running production line. They really sweat when informed that you need 6 weeks to retool/fix/upgrade etc. Those times when the plant shuts down for Christmas or Thanksgiving? management would prefer the manufacturing engineers working during that time since the plants already shut down. 

In an ideal world design engineering takes into account the concerns around how does the product get made and consults with manufacturing engineering. Sometimes it boils down to manufacturing being told to just ""make it work"". 

Starting up a new production line or having to retool means that there are a lot of moving pieces and they all have to work. To get them working requires lots of effort and time.

On top of that there can be somewhat of a boom/bust cycle with a factory. Once a factory is up and running smoothly and most of the issues are ironed out then they don't need as many manufacturing engineers...

So in summary, there are many companies where being the manufacturing engineer means signing up for long hours, unreasonable expectations, and maybe dubious job security."

I took a college class that covered the same info.  This is basically the foundation of computing, now in convenient browser game form!

It teaches you how basic logic gates are built up into more complex functions, and transitions from there into building a processor and coding examples in machine and assembly languages.  If you really want to understand what is going on under the hood, start here.  You can probably finish it in an afternoon or two.  It wont make you literate in embedded systems overnight, but a lot of things will make a lot more sense if you do."
A good reason for leaving company.,"I would just say that recent changes in the company make it less desireable to work there, and might also say thy with increasing lay-offs you are concerned about your career longevity there.

What percentage of engineers actively job hop every few years?,"I think there are a portion of engineers , especially young engineers, who do not understand the value they provide to a company.

This leaves room for companies to abuse wages and leave people to stagnate financially. This might be okay if you don’t acquire more work skills but I believe most of us become more useful over time.

I think the reason why most people switch is because they have climbed the ladder and wish to have their growth recognized.  

If a company can’t provide you with growth and/or pay increase it is not worth it to stay.

Put yourself out there and see what comes your way. Your never required to leave or stay. Make the choices that are appropriate for you."

Any Engineers here work in Recycling plants? I'm curious how the recycling process is affected when items are dirty or include non-recyclable parts?,"I work as an intern in a cardboard recycling plant. As for non-fibrous materials, we use a lot of devices called hydrocyclones to separate materials based on density, as well as a lot of screens to filter by physical size/particle orientation. As others have mentioned, a lot of grease in the board can swell fibers and make them harder to use, or cause the formation of “stickies” on felts and rollers, which can cause paper or felt tears. However, a few pizza boxes won’t destroy an entire batch, at least according to the process engineers. We get some really messy crap coming in, I’ve found chunks of glass in samples taken from screens and the like, and apparently they’ve been shipped loads that have dead animals. Generally as long as the hydrocyclones and screens are running right, we have no problem filtering stuff out after the stuff is repulped. Larger stuff (like the aforementioned carcasses) can be picked out manually before the pulper. 

If you want more information there’s some textbooks on paper recycling due to the large amount of equipment unique to paper production."

"How do distilleries ""switch"" to producing hand sanitizer or car factories ""retool"" to producing ventilators?","Distilleries distill alcohol to a certain alcohol concentration (it's in the name) for making rum/bourbon/etc. There's nothing preventing them from distilling to a higher concentration. Hand sanitizer can be made using that high concentration ethanol along with adding some emulsifier agent like Xanthan gum to make it thicker rather than a liquid. Alcohol production outside major production companies is a pretty manual process.

Again though, soap and water is much better than hand sanitizer at getting rid of viruses. Hand sanitizer is only for when you don't have immediate access to water&soap.

As to the ventilators, I know less about that."
Has anyone ever left a very small company?,"You seem to be confusing ""burning bridges"" with ""setting boundaries"".

"Solid shaft is always stronger than hollow shaft, right?","In tension and compression the stress is just force divided by cross sectional area. Solid has more cross sectional area and therefore lower stress.

Bending is more complicated but ultimately you're dividing by moment of inertia which is larger for a solid cylinder and therefore lower stress.

Torsion is the polar moment of inertia, which again is higher in the solid cylinder.

Ask him to specify how much material needs to be removed from the center to optimize the strength. Might solve the disagreement really quickly."

Stuck as a Paper Engineer in Aerospace,"So, I used to be in your position. Like, exactly your position. Systems engineering in aerospace sucks big time.

Unfortunately, the only reason I got out was because a friend pointed me to a job in an entirely different industry. If you're dead set on remaining in aerospace, good luck to you. Otherwise, I would recommend looking at other industries. Automotive has need of people with an aerospace mindset, for instance. 

You'll get a bit of slack because moving cross-industry means that the only thing they expect from you is engineering competency, since tools and processes are completely different.

No matter what, good luck."
I'm a junior engineer and I'm facing an ethical dilemma,"Allowing known defective materials to be used in a manner that puts lives at risk sounds like gross negligence to me. You have an ethical and moral responsibility to prevent that from happening. You may have a legal obligation as well (IANAL). I would take advantage of whistle-blower protections if any apply to you and attract governmental oversight immediately. 

Also, find a new job asap. 

Edit: Since this is at the top ... You should always try to correct the issue internally before going whistle-blower. You have a responsibility to your company and publicly shaming them is not appropriate unless you have exhausted your other options. /u/AlpacaSandwich went into much more detail and I agree completely."

Accidentally discovered salary lists,"I have been in an identical situation. I had been laid off from my previous job and money was tight so I was willing to take the first thing that came my way.

Anyway, about 8 months after starting my new job I learned that I was being paid about 30% less than my coworkers who started a year before me. I was pretty upset (very upset) so I took a week to cool off before bringing it up with anyone.

I asked to meet with the manager that hired me and basically said ""It's been brought to my attention that I'm getting paid (blah) while my coworkers are being paid (blah + 30%). What can we do to fix this?"" I ended up getting a raise up to just below what the more senior engineers were getting paid and an extra week of vacation.

The whole situation left a bad taste but I don't think sucking it up is the way to go if you wish to continue working there."

Here are the results from running a dehumidifier at low vs high speed (continuation of previous post),"Nice.  I have a Govee sensor for temp and humidity that connects to my phone where the historical data is stored.  I'd be curious how you may be able to normalize the varying humidity conditions between tests if you had something like that.

I'm currently working on reusing the humidity in my basement, which is really only present in the summer.  I live in the northeast, and in the summer my little dehumidifier collects about 2.5-3 gallons of water per 24 hour cycle.  Of course, in the summer is when we have high level droughts and water restrictions, so I grabbed a condensate pump at harbor freight and I'm now pumping the water it collects out to a rain barrel in my yard.

Next summer I'll be modifying the system to try to incorporate gravity fed irrigation directly from the barrel.

Do engineers get “pigeonholed” in the field they start their career in?,"It’s entirely possible to change course in your career at point, engineers pigeonhole themselves. 

For example, if you’ve been working at Ford for 10 years chances are you’re going to be very good at your job and have an attractive salary to suit. If you want to, say, work on wind turbines; you’ll not be an expert in this field and will have to take an appropriate demotion/pay cut to suit your skill level. Since most people aren’t willing to take the pay cut or loss of recognition/expertise they tend to stay put. 

Personally, I have worked in many different environments/roles (government, private, civil design, civil construction, mining, mechanical, electrical), each time I moved around I had to accept most of my acquired knowledge was no longer applicable and needed to start from scratch."

Even though the material is rated much stronger than our highest load predictions. The guys in our parachute shop have been laughing at me for weeks, saying we’re going way overboard and creating a science experiment. After 3 months we’re finally making it....it’s a fucking curtain. I know way too much about grommets now. "

How do you become a good engineer if all you have is textbook knowledge (no technical skills),"I've heard this before and I think it's worth mentioning: An engineering degree is just a learner's permit. It says you have gone through the steps to build a foundation from theory and now you're ready to actually learn what engineering is and how to do it. Don't sweat it, just come ready to learn.

People who hire/manage new ME's: what skills are most lacking in recent grads,"Apologies for mobile formatting...

Most employers will understand you aren't going to know relevant technical skills, entry level positions are to learn those skills. It's easy enough to teach someone most relevant on the job skills.

What interview candidates and new grads often struggle with is soft skills:
Ability to clearly and concisely communicate technical info

Intellectual humility to first try things out, then asking questions and using resources when you hit a wall

Time management and understanding priorities
 
How to work effectively on a team

When we interview, we'll focus more on behavioral questions that help us tease out those traits, e.g. tell us about a time you encountered a technical problem you couldn't solve, how did you approach it"

How do I work effectively with coworkers with Asperger’s syndrome?,"I have been a working PhD R&D scientist for 10 years. As you might imagine, I have worked with many people on various levels of the spectrum, and have befriended many as well. I make no claim that this advice will be universally applicable, but this has been my personal experience and what has worked for me.

First, always try to stay a calming force. Many people I have encountered who fall on the spectrum have difficulty controlling how they express their emotions. I have found nothing helps better than just being calm. My friends and coworkers have really responded well to me just remaining calm and working as logically and rationally as possible. 

I try to talk through my thinking in detail as I work collaboratively. I have found that colleagues have responded well once they are convinced that I am acting logically and rationally and that I approach problems in a detailed way. Once I attain that trust, I have found that they are much more willing to hear me when we disagree on solutions.

Remember that often, the person does not entirely comprehend how they come across to others. That can help one to have patience and compassion. There is also often difficulty in understanding other people's facial expressions and body language, so I make sure to vocalize feelings and thoughts clearly instead of assuming that they can tell that I am upset. I try to do this calmly and rationally, just explain how I am feeling and why.

Anyway, you will likely not be able to avoid the outbursts of emotion. Through patience and compassion you can develop fruitful relationships, but it won't always be easy."
Do engineers think about the little guys?,[deleted]
What are some things every early career Mechanical Engineer should know ?,People skills are often more important than technical skills.
"It’s 2019 and my cell phone barely gets reception inside of a plane while on land. In 2001, how were passengers able to make cell phone calls while above 10,000 ft moving at 400+ mph.","When cellphones were new, cells were created as large as possible to increase coverage, but frequency reuse is much more efficient the smaller cells get.  To shrink cells these days, telco's use highly directional panel antennas that VERY effectively shape the signal reception area to align with ground-level and just-above ground level.  This is because signal that overshoots a circular cell will actually interfere with the neighboring cell, so it's not just wasted power, it's destructive.

Back then, lots of cells were still just omnidirectional poles with poor vertical gain. It was all about range.  These antennas would bleed a lot more in the vertical axis and be much easier to pickup in the air.

So as time goes on, signal disappears from places the cell companies don't expect people to be at.  Some of the worst reception areas are the very tippy tops of mountains because cellular radiation patterns are so tightly controlled and no one points an antenna up."

"In a manual car, why must you press the gas pedal whilst releasing the clutch in order to move off?","At idle, with the gas pedal not pressed, the engine does not have enough inertia to continue spinning at the same speed if you suddenly connect the wheels to it. You can actually set off without pressing the gas pedal if you do it very slowly and carefuly as the RPM will begin to drop, the engine will detect this and increase the fuel being injected to try to maintain the RPM. Normally you want to set off quicker than this so you press the pedal to ensure the engine is ready to go. 

This is a lot easier in diesel engines vehicles. They have much more inertia and torque meaning they are less likely to stall but also because of these things, they cannot rev so high. 

Bonus:

1. If you depress the clutch pedal when moving, the engine is disconnected from the transmission so you can just rev the engine. It is like being in neutral. It won't stall if you are already moving though. 

2. Once fully released, the clutch is engaged and should not slip unless there is a problem. It should only slip momentarily as the pedal moves.

3. Yes. See above."
The question that supposedly impresses an interviewer,"I like to ask ""are there any skills important to the role that I haven't spoken to yet?""

Has anyone here left engineering to teach?,Acquaintance went from engineer to highschool chem teacher then back to engineering after a few years. They enjoyed the teaching but didn't enjoy the school politics which apparently affected every department. They also missed the problem solving of being in engineering. I think they now volunteer in some after school engineering programs.
Making a sewage treatment plant out of human parts.,"This is a fun question. I majored in Biological Systems Engineering and got a Master's in Environmental and Water Resource Engineering so I know a bit of both worlds, so here's a simplified analogy:

Water and wastewater treatment plants are similar, though it sounds like you are talking about a water treatment plant. In your common plants you have your intake-> screening-> flocculation and sedimentation-> filtering-> chlorination -> distribution.

This is for conventional freshwater treatment. Desalination is a whole other animal where you have to pre-treat the water with (more commonly) reverse osmosis or electrodialysis. RO uses pressure to push water through a semipermeable membrane, overcoming osmotic pressure. Suffice it to say it's not simple filtering.

So if you treat one human body as a scaled-down, analogous version of a treatment plant, the mouth and esophagus would be your intake lines. The teeth could serve as pre-screening bar screens to remove large items from entering. Your stomach and small intestine could then serve as the sedimentation basin where solids are allowed to settle out. The liver would act like sand filters, removing smaller particles that weren't removed by the screens (teeth) or sedimentation basin (stomach). Once you have your clean water, you can now add disinfectants like chlorine, similar to the way the pancreas adds digestive enzymes to complete digestion. And just like that, the water is ready for distribution.

I didn't go over the desalination process because our body doesn't handle saltwater so well. You would need another process or sink for it. I suppose if you used tongues as a sink, that might be analogous to electrodialysis in attracting the salt ions. Another detail is that the body does not disinfect water. It doesn't add chlorine or use UV light to disinfect like a normal plant would. So there's those limitations. In the end, with hearts serving as pumps, you could push the water out for distribution. Just make sure to include backflow prevention valves (like we have in our *veins*) so the water doesn't flow in reverse. Scale all this up with multiple body parts, and baby you got yourself a stew.

Edit: Backflow prevention valves are found in our veins.

Edit 2: I'm more knowledgeable about water treatment and engineering than microbiology and physiology. See the comments for more details submitted by you fine people."
How do you deal with Tribal knowledge?,"On one hand, there's nothing you can really do short of paying a few of the individuals who left with the most knowledge consulting rates to get them in and help train and advise.

On the other hand, you've never had a better opportunity to change the tribal standards, whether that being processes, perceived limitations, and leadership structure that might result in a better outcome than before, when clearly how they were doing it didn't lead to the best outcome."
Salary raise - Imposter Syndrome,[deleted]
How many of y'all actually liked school better than work and why?,Very different and hard to compare. Overall I liked working better. I like having weekends and evenings free. I miss the social aspect of school and getting to work on a lot of different things and interact with a lot of different people. But it was also a lot more stressful and high pressure in my opinion.
Do you have experience with the constant fear that you can be fired at any moment?,"Best advice I was ever given by my first Engineering Manager - ""Good job, you made it past your 90 day review, now the only way you'll get fired is for stealing proprietary information, coming to work drunk, or lighting the building on fire"""

"Applied for Position, Next Morning CEO of Company Added Me on LinkedIn - Should I Reach Out? Is This a Good Sign?","It probably wouldn't be a terrible idea (as a hiring manager I certainly wouldn't be offended by someone reaching out, though not sure it would necessarily help either) but your response should depend on the following:

1) What are the privacy settings on your LinkedIn account? 
2) How much experience do you have? 
3) How senior a role did you apply for? 

The reason I ask is because if it's a small company and you applied to anything that requires a reasonable amount of experience, the CEO is probably still pretty familiar with the goings on in the company, knows what they're hiring for, and was curious about your experience/history. Depending on your LinkedIn privacy settings, he may not have been able to see any detail unless he added you as a connection. But if you have a completely open account where all of that stuff is visible to anyone and he still added you, that (to me) would be a better sign."

Current or former Tesla employees.. Is Tesla really that bad for salaried employees?,"I was a senior MechE there for a few years, left in 2019. Would have a $6M stock package as of today had I stayed. Whomp whomp.

What do you want to know? Also I wasn't in Austin and your experience will be very division and team-dependent. That said there are certainly cultural issues/quirks that broadly apply to everyone.

My stock anecdote should give you pause, because *in general* (but not always) Tesla pays below market for most experience levels. I doubled by compensation going to FAANG. That was without the absurd stock growth. *With* the stock growth what I actually did was cut my compensation to 20% of what I'd have made at Tesla. Assuming the stock stays up of course.

Anyone going in *now* and getting stock at the current valuation has to ask: Do I think it's likely the stock will continue to go up? 2x? Another 10x? Is it possible for Tesla to get a 5 Trillion valuation because reasons and don't think about it? I suppose anything is possible. It's also possible for the market cap to plummet  to 1/5 of its current value. What happens if Elon dies?? You just don't know. If it continues on its upward tear, maybe it really could 5x before crashing and taking the S&P 500 with it. But if, at any point, it resets to a more sane value and actually has to *grow into* a multi-trillion valuation, that could take many years. Could take a decade or two. Could also never happen. Getting in when it's at an all-time high is a risk that you'll have to weigh yourself.

All that side, I'll throw out a few brief comments from my experience. Feel free to ask for elaboration on any of them or on something I didn't address:

* Jank rules supreme at Tesla. We all know this. The part of the production line that was featured in tours was the one that Grohmann automation built (who Tesla has since acquired). It looks modern, clean, and futuristic. The other 90% of the factory looks mostly filthy and like a collection of senior projects and robot arms. There are many processes which really should be done in a clean room but are just done in a dirty factory atmosphere next to a few exterior doors that are open to the windy high desert.
* Speaking of safety: most employees I encountered take it as seriously as they're able to. Make of it what you will. Giant forklifts rolling down aisles where you have to squeeze yourself up against a machine cell while the thing rolls past 2 feet in front of you, daily occurrence. Maybe the plexiglass will stop it?People going to the ER because they had a battery module dropped on them? Happened a couple times. If you're in a factory environment you need to watch out for yourself. Really that's good advice in *any* factory.
* Working late was a staple, but many engineers work late just because they think they have to and never test those boundaries. I started dipping at 5pm after a year there, and nobody cared unless we were actively needed on the line.
* Holidays are all over the place. Engineers worked through thanksgiving, Xmas, and on New Year's Eve. Sometimes you can get out of it, sometimes you can't. If you want to travel to see family just know that your holidays are always subject to change until a day before. Told you you're off but you're actually on? Tough luck. Told you you're on but you're actually off? Too late to buy flights so hope you've got friends in Austin.
* Getting called in at 2am, or on a Saturday, or at 2am on a Saturday: yes it happens. If you're on the product side, less of a concern. If you're in manufacturing, expect it here and there. Line uptime > your time off.
* You will watch the value of your stock package swing up and down by tens (or hundreds) of thousands of dollars on a weekly and sometimes daily basis. Usually in response to some Elon tweet. You can really feel the mood change when you walk in one morning and everyone just watched $10k get shaved off their upcoming vest. Hope you can cope.
* If you're the type of person to pop a monocle because of a lack of professionalism, it may not be for you. I saw more than one production associate (euphemism for factory button-pusher) walking around wearing a graphic tee featuring nude anime girls with huge tits. Nobody seemed to care, and no skin off my back, but if that bothers you...

On to the good:

* My team was mostly very good, and I had truly excellent managers. Best of any job so far and due to the culture they were all technically competent. How often do you have a senior manager coming in to do low-level troubleshooting with the engineering team, and actually *knowing wtf they're doing?* It's a beautiful thing.
* If you're the type to have a panic attack and need a mental health day when someone raises their voice at you: it's not the environment for you. Conversely, if you're the type of person that is fucking sick and tired of wishy-washy corpo-happy-speak, you might love it. Anyone who's had a performance review or 1-on-1 who thought ""Wait, so am I doing well or not?"" can relate. ChrisBreaksUpWithAnn.txt. This is more a west-coast thing IMHO. At Tesla it was very clear: ""You're fucking up, you did a great job with X but if you don't Y and Z, things will not go well for you."" Crystal. Also I could get away with telling someone ""that's a stupid fucking idea, are you serious?"" in a meeting, *provided* that it actually WAS a stupid fucking idea and I could prove it.
* Everyone claims they hate meetings, but Tesla at least acts on it. If you're not needed in a meeting (or not needed any longer) you can just stand up and walk out. The employee handbook and Elon himself *demand* that you walk out.
* Free cereal?
* You learn a lot, and you have a lot of ownership of your projects and you wear many hats. Their success or failure is often entirely riding on you. That means *your* success or failure is often riding entirely on you. Exciting and engaging for some, terrifying for others.
* Tenures tend to be short at Tesla. If you are good, you will advance *very* fast. If I'd stayed I'd have gone from senior ME to staff ME + running a team of \~10 in 2 years.
* Conversely, if you are bad, you will get dropped in a real hurry. And sometimes not even if you're ""bad,"" just not ""the best."" My first day at Tesla, the first email I got when I set up my Tesla accounts was the one from Elon about how they're firing 10% of all employees. Like 5 people from my small team were let go. And you won't be able to skate by for weeks/months just not doing much, as you can at many other big tech companies.
* You get to be part of the insanity that is Tesla. That's pretty cool.
* If you have multiple skillsets, you'll probably get to use them at Tesla. If you are an ME but can write software, you can find a way to do both. I'm an ME that has a fairly strong EE skillset, and I designed a bunch of PCBs that are still running in multiple factories.

All in all I'd say it was a positive experience. My former team and managers periodically ask me to come back, and it's pretty tempting because while I get paid more where I am now, and I have way more time and energy to do the stuff *I* want to do, the work was pretty engaging and the fun times were a lot of fun. And I had a good rapport going with the team, we went out all the time, we got that ""working in the trenches"" (sorry for being dramatic) camaraderie. I miss them! Still keep in touch with them and my old manager. 

And to temper all that, I'll add that Tesla is the only place I've ever worked that made me question if I even wanted to be an engineer. I used to do a ton of personal engineering projects, I worked on products I wanted to manufacture and sell, I had a bitchin' EE lab I used all the time, etc. I've done none of that since starting at Tesla and even after leaving, and the lab is still in boxes. It broke something inside me that I'm still trying to fix. $1.7M a year might have taken the edge off, but I'd had enough and lacked a crystal ball so here we are.

Ultimately: you go in with your eyes open. Don't go in and feign ignorance of the culture and expectations there; you know exactly what you're signing up for. Some people hate it and burn out. Some people love it and thrive. Some, like me, are kinda in the middle. I'd say I was definitely thriving in terms of my contributions, skill advancement, and career advancement, and I loved a lot of the work and the scrappiness and circumstance about it. But I value my *own* work and hobbies just as much and I didn't have the time or energy to do those things, so I had to make a change.

TL;DR: Family man who never misses a little league game and is always home for dinner? Better find other ways to show your kids/wife you love them. Single 22 year old with no real obligations or attachments? YOLO bro."
Is my company screwing me over?,"IMO, $85k for a software dev with 5 years experience is not good. And saying that someone with 3 years at a company can't lead is either A) the company telling you something about your personality (ie they don't trust you), or B) the company places more value on tenure than ability (also bad).

I'd bail."
Where can I go after Raytheon?,"When Raytheon bought out Hughes in the late 90s they were based in Dallas.  To consolidate operations they closed the Dallas facility and attempted to move everyone to the former Hughes facility in Tuscon.  I'm sure you know this.  What you may not be aware of is that it was a blood bath.  The budding cell phone industry in Dallas caught wind and started sending mass mailings out, renting billboards, etc.  Basically, if you worked RF for Raytheon, the cell phone industry had a job for you!  As the stories made it to this neck of the woods, Raytheon had not expected that and they absolutely took it in the shorts as most of their RF work force abandoned ship.  I do know that Raytheon as a company was comically inept for a number of years afterwords as the brain drain had devastated them.

So.... Have you looked in the cell industry?

Also, seems like anyone who does telemetry (NASA, SpaceX, etc.) would be interested."

"Is it a bad idea to tell the interviewer that you have other interviews scheduled, and an offer from their competitors to speed up the process and maybe salary?","It's also OK to be interviewing and talking to everyone simultaneously. With regards to mentioning other interviews and pending offers, I'd just be straightforward with it. There's no need to name drop anything, but a simple ""this isn't the only opportunity I have on the table right now"" would suffice.

If you go on and interview somewhere else, get an offer, and this company still hasn't caught up. A simple ""Where are we at in the process, I have multiple offers  right now and need to make a decision?"" can force their hand.

Delays like this are sometimes used because you're not their #1 candidate, but they want to keep you in the lineup in case #1 declines or doesn't work out."
"When people say ""the grid isn't build to handle lots of decentralized renewables"" what exactly are they talking about?","The grid isn’t really capable of large scale energy storage at the moment so there has to be a balance between generation and consumption at all times. Where there is an imbalance the difference is stored/consumed as kinetic energy in the large synchronous generators at centralised power stations eg if there is to much power consumed than generated then the generators slow down and the grid frequency is lowered. This change in frequency is only small and temporary as operators will instruct the centralised power stations to start outputting more power in response to this. The problem with a lot of renewables is that they do not have synchronous generators. Solar uses voltage source converters, and wind, while it does have generators, these are generally variable speed and so aren’t directly coupled to the grid and cannot contribute to the grids stability in the same way that synchronous generators can, but there are areas of research that are looking into how to replicate the same effect that synchronous generators have on grid stability. If you’re interested just have a google of “synthetic inertia”

"For those that ""quit"" engineering as a career, what did you switch to?",Left manufacturing after 6 years in aerospace and utilities. Started teaching high school math this year. It’s complicated with COVID but I have zero regrets. Took a big pay cut but it’s so much more fulfilling than what I was doing. It feels like my effort actually matters besides affecting someone’s bottom line or a P&L report. I get to share my experience with the kids and they share theirs with me. I find myself excitedly telling my wife about interactions I had throughout the day with my students and I daydream about their successes during my commute.
"If a fan powered with 50W is placed into a closed system, say an insulated box, does it add 50W of heat inside the box when it's run?",This What-If is related to your question and is pretty interesting: [https://what-if.xkcd.com/35/](https://what-if.xkcd.com/35/)
"Professionally, have you ever had to draw a line in the sand?","Yes, kinda; It wasn't unethical or unsafe but it violated our own policies and set a terrible precedent that I knew would haunt us. I resisted up to the point I was told I'd be fired if I continued to resist, at which point I logged my objections in a memo in the job folder and did the work.  

The next year there were new elected officials in charge and I got to un-do the work. That felt good. Still cost $80k to un-do, which was more than it cost to do in the first place ($70k)."
"On a scale of 1 to 10, how stressed are you at work and how stressed were you in engineering school?","It's a different type of stress. Let me put it in allegory.

In school, you are on a superhighway-like path with a huge caravan of people and your stress is all about the speed at which you are moving along that path. If you are moving too slowly to keep with the crowd. If you stray off the path and lose the group. It's all about speed of learning. This obviously is super stressful, but in a well known and well worn way.

In your career, you are in a wilderness; most of the time in a pretty small team, sometimes by yourself. Sometimes there's a well defined trail and you are worried about making time along that trail to a destination (say, releasing a product to manufacturing). Other times you are off the path entirely and monsters are jumping out at you and you are trying to protect people from those monsters (troubleshooting a problem). Still other times you are trail blazing from a known place to an unknown place and making a path for others to follow (R&D). And lastly, sometimes, you are just map making (documentation).

If school is defined by learning and the stress from that, career is defined by pressure of the unknown and the stress arising from that. Personally, I was more stressed in school because it was more acute. Career stress is more slow burning; much longer running but lower magnitude. With a career comes more personal agency, which gives you more tools to manage your stress, should you choose to make use of those tools (some people don't, and those are the ones who explode)."

I feel physically sick about this upcoming interview.,"Don't worry too much about the time.  It's not your role to fill the full time.  They won't sit down, say ""explain why you should get this job"" and start a timer to make sure you'll ask.

They'll have questions they want to ask and follow up probing questions.  Answer honestly, take your time, and breath between sentence :-).

Make yourself a list of questions to ask about the company so when they say ""Do you have any questions"", you don't have to think of any.  Some suggestions:

* What does a normal day look like for someone in this role?
* What is the biggest challenge in this roll?  What is the biggest opportunity for improvement?
* For people who start in this role, what does their career look like 3-5 years later?
* What do you personally enjoy the most about working for company XXX?

Spend some time thinking about your project and work history.  If you can, make some quick notes about both accomplishments and challenges (stuff that didn't work).

When asked to describe ""a time when"" something happened, try to answer in STAR format:

* S - Situation (What is the background?)
* T - Task (What did you need to do?)
* A - Action (What did you do to address the task?)
* R - Result (What happened because of your action?)

This helps make sure you give enough detail and provides a framework for your answer.

Good luck!"
Anyone know how to balance engineering with wanting to have uninterrupted periods of adventure in there life?,"I worked with a guy who would do six months of contracting, then six months exploring.

He did work lots of hours when he was working, and lived a very frugal lifestyle.

He was also exceptionally talented and had lots of domain experience."
The AskEngineers Salary Survey - possibility of including gender?,"I think gender is an important demographic. I had a really good female engineer (my manager at the time) mentor me and her advice was to always ASK and discuss salary because she found in her career that less females ask for a raise than males. She also found that males seem to negotiate more and more aggressively than females do. 

I’ve always been afraid of negotiation, but once I had an interview for a place I wasn’t really seriously considering, so I followed the advice of a male mentor (another engineer at a manager position). I asked for a certain salary which I felt I didn’t quite deserve yet. Turns out the company offered me almost what I asked for which was still a very decent pay jump!! Actually, I didn’t ask for as much as the male engineer told me to ask for - I even knocked it down a little bit because I felt like it was too much. He tells me this type of thought process is very common in females over males (the whole “I don’t deserve this much”) and that can result in a pay gap. 

I will always ask be turning to my male peers for advice before applications/interviews now!"
What calibrates the calibraters?,"This is one of the topics that makes me go squee.  

In general, this is the notion of ""calibration traceability"".  If something has a calibration sticker, this means that there is a chain of successively more accurate instruments  connecting it to a standards body's measurement of the appropriate physical constant.

In practice in the US, this results in traceability chain that is at most 3 hops between your instrument and the NIST standard.

If you really want to nerd out about this kind of thing this book tells you the methods of creating arbitrarily accurate standards of flatness and straightness from nothing.

How did your school teach you about being a whistleblower?,"ABET accreditation requires the teaching of engineering ethics iirc. Whistle-blowing is a core subject of engineering ethics.

I remember in class walking through the story of a real engineer who blew the whistle, was severely punished for doing so, but was ultimately proven right.

At least in my industry we have an annual refresher training on ethics (both business and engineering). It highlights the many avenues to raise concerns: Your line managers, head of engineering, head of QA, the companies employee concerns system, your clients reporting systems, the government reporting system (EPA, DOE, NRC, GAO, etc.), and so on."

Why are there no submarines that carry passengers?,"1. because its not economically viable. A cruise ship uses most of the volume available to  accommodate passengers. A submarine on the other hand need a large percentage of its volume for its operation, this includes the boyancy tanks which take up a significant space.
2. its relatively un safe. even though u mak think that is the same with ships and submarines as they both travel on water, the fact that you can go under water multiplies the risk significantly. even if the ship were to capsize, it would give its occupants enough time to abandon ship ang get into rescue boats. A submarine on the other hand has no such luxuary. if its unable to resurface for any reason, then you are pretty much stuck
3. the ocean is not as deep as you think. yes, the ocean is very deep in some places. its even deep enough to swallow Mt. Everest and still have much depth to spare. But, closer to coasts, its not very deep and you will find out that military subs have to choose between surfacing or going around an under water obstacle.
4. you may be aware of waves on the surface of the ocean, but you have to know there are much stronger and dangerous currents flowing underwater. some of them are so dangerous that you would be pulled down thousands of meters if you are not carefull. 
5. the mental stress and the physical pressure of being under water is a very taxing endevour on the human body. its by no means comparable to a cruise. you may be fine for a couple of days, but confined space, recycled air and inability to see the sun will make it less than a pleasurable experience."
"Co-Mentored Young Engineer Seen As Lazy, But Is Not","Edit: I didn't originally see the ""Many of my colleagues feel that way"" line. Definitely interview colleagues and try to see what they're seeing.

So he 100% has to run certain experiments. Those experiments sometimes have moderate periods of time when they don't require any human interaction (""downtime""). During those ""downtimes"" the young engineer  does other actual work tasks rather than playing on his phone or merely sitting there looking busy.

I'd say this engineer is not lazy just on account of that. The fact that I have to break it down to one individual, non-deniable fact leads me to think you're being pushed around a bit as well, and no longer trust your own opinion.

I would guess that the working from home is causing some workplace friction, which shouldn't be his fault. It's always important though for people who work from home to have concrete demonstrations showing how much work they got done. Mainly because most people are bad judges of productivity and suffer from horrible confirmation bias when it comes to working from home.

Additionally, your young engineer may have gaps in his social skillset which lead to getting bullied. It sounds like this ""heatsink"" guy is a low-esteem bully and young engineer doesn't have the social toolset to make himself a poor target choice for bullying behaviors.

If you are 100% sure the managers think the young engineer is doing good work, and you can objectively prove he's doing good volume / good quality....I would bring up the ""we are all sick of carrying your lazy ass"" comment with management.

That remark, if quoted accurately, is toxic and unprofessional. We shouldn't need to tell you that - which makes me wonder how you are being treated that you don't feel conviction in your opinion about it. It's something a team would say to an individual when they are done trying to help them improve and just want the person to quit.

I would also take additional steps first:

 - informally interview the whole team, see how other team members view the new guys work.
 - doublecheck that the new guy is actually delivering/being easy to reach / responds to emails and IMs reasonable quickly when he's working from home
 - when you do bring it up with management, first ask their opinion of him, if it's positive, reinforce it with ""that's how I've felt also, he's always busting his ass with (a & b), and I've been really impressed by [short story c]. However, ""heatsink"" has been cornering him and making comments to him about his work ethic that it doesn't seem like anyone else shares with heatsink. Normally this wouldn't be an issue but I dont want new guy to start feeling that he's actually not valued here, because he brings a lot to the team and we're better off with him here."""
"If you are salary, what do you consider to be your work hours, 40 hours only, 40-45, 45-50, as many as are required?","Even though we are salaried, we have to account for 40 hours on our timecards.  Therefore my work week is 40 hours.  Management will argue that you are salaried so you work whatever it takes to get the job done, but since I can't leave early on Friday if I'm done with everything, I'm not staying late either if I'm not done."
Am I out of line for telling my manager’s boss that we don’t have enough resources and that work/life balance isn’t ideal?,"Skip level meetings are exactly for that. Sometimes managers need to go over the leads, or directors go over managers. Whatever the case, it is a skip level meeting.

My nephew (16) is wanting to learn some basic robotics. Where is a good place to get self taught? (Doesn't have to be free.),"This may be a bit more than you asked for but maybe push your nephew to start a FIRST robotics team at his school?  Its well known, brings donations and volunteers with the name, and is great structured intro into the world of robotics.  And really is self directed by the students.  

I volunteered with a team. It started just a few kids after school weekly with a couple hundred dollars of school funding.  And grew into a really amazing team in the couple years before I joined."
I wanted to ask my fellow engineers what kind of office chairs they use while working from home?,"I strongly recommend checking an office furniture liquidator / reseller if you have some local to you.

You can often find name brand chairs from Herman Miller, Steelcase, Haworth for a fraction of their street price - plus they're already assembled. 

If you can stretch up to $250-300 you can often find used examples from the above brands in decent shape and they'll hold up for a long time, replacement parts are cheap and easy to get. If you spend less on something from a big box store its probably a lot more cheaply constructed and won't hold up as long, won't keep your posture as well, and not have easily replacement parts like arm rests, seat cushions, etc.

Like others in the comments, I got a loaded Haworth Very Task chair for $250 still in plastic wrap, plus I was able to contact a Haworth service provider and get a replacement arm pad  for free after 3 years and the chair is still covered under warranty for years to come."
"Engineers in ‘firefighting’ roles, how do you quantify your achievements in interviews?","If you're looking to have a STAR type bullet point with dollars in it, a good comparison I always found when I was a manufacturing engineer was the reduction in downtime hours from previous years.

Even if your job is entirely reactive, say in the case of responding to product issues in the field, that's quantifiable in terms of ensuring customer satisfaction and the dollar value of the product sold/affected.

The question is really ""what is quantifiable about your work?"". Start there and work backwards if you have to."
Who has quit their engineering career? What happened next?,"I've worked with 5 different companies in 10 years, plus freelance consulting on the side. Its given me the insight as to what I like and what I don't. I'd recommend adding variety to your resume - it will help you see new paths you never considered, and realize things you hadn't noticed before about what you like.

Stick with engineering, or at least something peripheral to it. There's so many possible career paths, I doubt you've explored the possibility of even 10% of them. There's bound to be something you like.

Just ditch your current company. It's pulling you down, and your subconscious has already written it off. In my experience, it's not possible to un-writeoff a company, or at least I haven't been successful."

I finally learned to quantify my achievements. Turning my work into numbers really helped dispel the biases that came around during performance reviews. For example,

* I had discovered 48% of the discrepancies when I was on an 11 person team. I had discovered 100% of the highest severity discrepancies. Yet I was being told that the other engineers were better than me. No proof given to that claim. 
* I was responsible for the software for 3 satellites when my male peers were responsible for 1 satellite each. Yet they were trying to tell me that my male peers were better. No proof given for that claim. 
* I created a real time simulator and was told that I was a mediocre engineer. Yet they had to replace me with **six** men for the upgrade. The new team could never meet the timing requirements. That’s a big fail in real time systems. 

Using hard numbers exposes the ridiculousness of performance review bias. 

One of my biggest regrets was playing too nice when people tried to throw me under the bus. I wish I had pushed back more when people made false claims about my work. Instead I tried to “get along”.  Yet I was still told I was “too aggressive”. 

The reality is that there will always be “that guy” who sees a woman as vulnerable and will try to blame their failures on you.  Unfortunately, “that guy” also has managers that believe him without question."
Mechanical consulting engineer considering career break after loss and looking for some perspective/advice,"Oh my goodness. I’m so incredibly unqualified to say anything! But, I do have opinions. And I’m old and experienced.

Something I said in another post. I’ve never regretted doing something for personal growth. 

Take a break, quit, find a different job, like completely different. I always saw myself working at the local surf shop. Or fixing bikes. Or just being an artist. Hang in my garden. Go find yourself again. You’re still here, just a bit lost. And that’s OK, grief is as long as you need it to be; there are no timetable. 

And one day, come back if you want. People go on leave all the time and come back to work. Not mandatory, but doable, so low risk.

Why is the drop out rate so high?,"The school I went to had a \~55% drop out/transfer by end of sophomore year for mechanical engineering. Some of the students transferred to other engineering majors because they did not realize what the other majors actually did. The vast majority who dropped out of the school just weren't cut out for engineering or pressured into becoming an engineer by there parents/teachers/counselors/etc. Then about 5% would either require additional time to graduate. Drop out rates between junior/senior year were less than 1%.

My freshman roommate got kicked out because he did no homework and rarely attended lectures. He just thought he could skate through like he did in high school. My sophomore roommate realized mechanical engineering was not his thing got a bachelors in computer science. One of the guys in my study group was basically told he would be kicked out of his family if he was not an engineer or a doctor. He dropped out to go to culinary school and now owns a little bakery that is fairly successful."

"Engineers from other disciplines who switched to Software, was the grass greener on the other side?","There are definitely some benefits. I get to work from home full time, and the demand for software engineers is very high right now (and probably will be for a while) so switching jobs is relatively easy (assuming you can pass the interview stage of course). A lot of the other perceived perks (pay, work life balance, etc.) will depend heavily on the company. Some software engineers are still way underpaid and work terrible hours. To answer your question, for me the transition to software engineering worked out very well, but I know others who hated it and went back to mechanical/electrical work."
My boss is unusually focused on me .. I hate it,"Based on your age, I’d assume you’re one of the more junior employees in the office.  That **MIGHT** be the cause of more frequent meetings.  Your feelings are probably right, but can you put it into objective terms?

  * Are his conversations focused on work?

  * Does he often ask you personal questions?

  * Does he stand too close or inadvertently touch your arm/shoulder?

  * How does he treat junior male employees?

   * Does he make everyone give face to face reports?  Or does he accept written updates from others?

  * Are there other female employees you can ask as a sanity check?

(Don’t answer those here, just think about them. HR will want to know these things if you file a report)

If you determine his behavior isn’t inappropriate, but still want to avoid the meetings, email him an update half hour before the meeting.  He’ll still want to review it but it should go faster.  If he asks questions be sure to add those points in next week’s pre-email.  Eventually he’ll realize the meetings are a waste because you’ve proactively already told him everything. 

Or he won’t because some people just love pointless meetings."

Why do tractors seem to have so much longer service life vs other commercial vehicles?,"There's a lot of factors here. 

A big one is RPM and speed. trucks go 60, tractors go 6. 

tractor's are built to lift, carry, and use heavy loads. that means everything is overbuilt. trucks just have to pull stuff. They get way less weird loading. 

With trucks you have a push for efficiency. That makes systems more complex and precise. tractor MPG ratings are not as big of a deal. 

Emissions regulations apply differently as well, trucks have more stuff in them to manage that.

Another is lifecycle. No matter what a farmer will tell you they do not run their tractors anywhere near to the same hours that a long haul trucker does."
"I made an podcast for engineers, can anyone give some feedback?","Hello, I am a student currently studying engineering. I've given your first podcast a listen and I enjoyed it. It is nice to hear about what's going on in the real world of engineering compared to being stuck in a textbook all day. I feel the first episode was a good length, and you do well with a monologue. The only thing I disliked was the goofy intro and outro music, it sounds like an old game console having a stroke and distracts from the intro and conclusion a lot.

"Is it true that if a Professional Engineer's design fails, they are responsible and could be sent to jail?","Depends on the failure.

If the design documents show that standards & best practices were ignored, then it's very possible - at that point negligent homicide charges could be brought.

On the flip side if standards, laws, regional codes & best practices are followed, designs are unlikely to fail - which is the reason they exist.

Some outside interference can't be taken into account though. You won't have to design a family home in rural Kansas to withstand a plane impact; however not designing a skyscraper to be earthquake proof in tokyo is just asking for trouble."

Before committing to one of these, I'd suggest trying a self-paced free basic course on [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/) to see if you actually like programming. Of the languages, I'd recommend Python since it's most similar to MATLAB, which many ME's learn in college."
"What is the best way to be successful in engineering, if you struggle with upper level math?","Understand that math is a skill to-be-developed, and not something for which you have (or do not have) some innate ability. Being good at solving math problems comes come solving lots of math problems. Every hard problem you encounter is solved by reducing it to an easier problem you’ve solved before. Read your textbook ahead of class, work all the examples problems yourself, and give yourself time to work through assignments so you can seek help.

You’ll likely have gaps in your knowledge to fill in; don’t let these persist once you’ve identified them. Strive to master every module of your courses, because it all builds up for the first two years of courses."
How do I stop shocking myself?,"Wear something made from cotton beneath the jacket.  Avoid silk and synthetic fabrics.

Also, rather than holding onto something metallic just keep something small and conductive at hand.  Such as keys.  Take off the jacket, grab the keys, then touch the keys to a metal object to discharge yourself safely."
Is it difficult to get into Grad school after you’ve been in the workforce with a low undergrad GPA?,"People who have done this: if you’ve been working in industry and you start applying to schools that require academic references, do you just start firing emails at your old professors? I went to a fairly large state school, and I doubt the professors would remember me if I needed a reference from them."
"My boss, who I need to sign off on my engineering experience, has suddenly become very hostile. Any advice on how to handle the situation?","Go to the next higher up person with your concerns. You’ve approached him and done everything he asked, yet he’s still being hostile. Make sure you document everything so his boss can see exactly what has happened. And it’s going to be easy to rest on your laurels here, but press it. You shouldn’t have to put your life on hold bc someone else is being unprofessional. You have the requisite amount of time in accordance with NCEES requirements so you’re solid. Go to the next higher person."
Engineering Salaries for 2019,"I think these are all great offers for a recent grad. It's impressive that you had that many options as well, let alone good ones. I think you are off to a far better start than the average recent eng grad, so hats off to you for getting those opportunities. I think this post is only applicable to top tier students though. Not to deter the average grad from seeking out these  offers, but I'd hate to see someone turning down early offers, especially as a first job out of school just because they think they're worth more. Getting that experience out of school is most important, you can make moves later to earn more money."
Mechanical grad and I cannot find a job,"Its the same everywhere for mechE grads. I know it is the case for the US. 
It is because of covid primarily. The aircraft industry is the problem since they lost so  much due to covid. Boeing laid of THOUSANDS (yes, not hundreds - look it up) of employees. So thats why in the US entry level mechanical engineering positions just take people with 5-10+ years of experience. 

I’m a software engineer personally and the industry is doing really well there. Very easy to find a job. So perhaps you can try and learn coding and switch gears? It will take you 6-12 months from 0 background but you may have some background so can take you less. A lot of my friends are mechE and my wife is also just finishing masters in mechE. It is hard for mechE. Its because of covid and the aircraft industry primarily. So dont worry too much and wait hopefully and keep trying your best."
"Is there a reason why ""corporate lingo"" is still a thing?","Listen Timmy, it's about obtaining better alignment with our team members to mitigate risk and promote skill synergies.

Almost done with engineering degree but don't want to be an engineer,FINISH the degree.  Mechanical engineering is extremely versatile and over day you'll regret not completing those 3 semesters.
"""Not an Engineer"" but work with the best in the world.","I'll be honest. I've met tons of engineers that were terrible. They were smart enough to take the classes and get the grades, but their brains just lack that fundamental ""engineer-ism.""

I've also met plenty of guys that have [the knack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8vHhgh6oM0), but never got a degree. It sounds like you're in this category. Folks that just figure things out, get stuff done, and whose opinions can be trusted. Lean into that. You don't need the degree but you can still do all sorts of technical work and make decent money without the engineering degree or title. I've known a few draftsmen and CAD designers without degrees that were just so good at design work, and learned so much about materials, strengths, machining operations, etc., that my company promoted them to engineer roles, with engineer salaries, and waved the degree requirement. Maybe something like that is in your future."
How do I address a bad gpa when employers ask for transcripts?,"Find a job as a field engineer or field supervisor for a small time contractor, stay there for ~3 years, get some field smarts, then just forget about your GPA. It doesn’t have to be on your resume forever.

I had problems with drugs and mental health in college. Now I’m 6 years out and that’s all completely behind me and no future employers will ever find out."
"My sister and I want to figure out how many foot pounds the average toddler (35-45 lbs, 3-4 yrs) could produce",What height is the toddler dropped from?
Have you ever refused to share your engineering knowledge/skills or met someone who did so that no one else can catch up?,"Worked with an engineer who was wholly uninterested with sharing their knowledge. They had decades of experience and hoarded it over everyone, making it a commodity....until we all started to learn elsewhere and that person's value wasn't quite as high after that, because the rest of us started to change how our team performed the work and that person suddenly needed to catch up. I do not work with that person anymore and I advise folks to stay light years away from that kind of person."
How to make myself a “proactive” engineer,"They are correct that you need to be proactive, but I have a bit of a problem with that as a criticism of an engineer just starting out. Interns and co-ops are usually told what to do, so at this point in your career, you could be proactive by nature but have not had the chance to demonstrate it.  But I bet if you think about it, you can come up with something. 

One thing that served me well in my early days was taking projects as far as I could on my own. Then, I’d ask the mechanics and craftsmen for their input, then run my thoughts past the older engineers. 

If you don’t yet have any examples of proactivity in a professional setting, think of examples from class or real life. 

I wish you well."
Young Engineers dreams VS Experienced,"The idea of a ""one man show"" who can do everything by themselves. I wanted to be that guy. These days I realize that anything big enough to be significant generally takes a team of people to pull off.

All of us is greater than any of us."
"Did anyone here jump ship to the software industry after getting a more traditional engineering degree? (i.e. Chemical, Mechanical, Electrical). If so, do you have any tips for someone who is exploring that idea?","I switched from mechanical to software. 

The easiest route would probably be finding something where chemistry is needed. I had a contract job as a bioinformatics software engineer which is a combination of biology and software. You could look for jobs that combine chem and software."

But the job responsibilities will not be less. How do I plead my case that I should get the two pay grade jump?,"If you were an external candidate with your experience would you be having this discussion?  You can also let him know that if that is what the market seems this job is worth, then you now know you may be able to go out and get that somewhere else."
Do you think your company will relax WFH policies after covid-19 calms down?,[deleted]
Do we build anything on the surface of the earth that doesn't assume a flat surface?,"Curvature of the earth is 8 inches per mile, and colliders definitely have to take this into account.  [https://www.tunneltalk.com/CERN-10Dec2014-Future-Circular-Collider-preliminary-alignment-studies.php](https://www.tunneltalk.com/CERN-10Dec2014-Future-Circular-Collider-preliminary-alignment-studies.php)"
"Can you help me destroy 15,000 us Gallons of eggs per week?","I don't think we've ever done straight eggs before. Done lots of chicken processing. Dewatered tons (literally) of eggshells. Beaks, heads, random other parts. Even dewatered entire chicken breasts. Eggs might be new though.

Acetone's a good place to start. Could be interesting to try ferric sulfate, sulfuric acid or something else along those lines, denature the eggs, back that up with a long-chain polyacrylamide if required, and then dewater the result. Crushed eggshells won't hurt the process in the slightest, might even help. 15k gallons is only 6.5 GPM over a 40 hour workweek, not a huge throughput rate, although the solids loading will be impressive for that size.

What condition do you need the eggs in to 'process' them? What's the endstate use- landfill, animal feed, something else?

**Edit:** Saw another comment. Our basic standard is to get it solid enough that you can put it in a dump truck, leave it there, and not have water leaking out, so it sounds like that meets one requirement. We do free bench testing if you'd like us to give it a try.

**Edit 2:** Just remembered our field engineers are Redditors. It's like an organic chem refresher opportunity, right guys? Can't be any worse than the curdled milk or raw WWTP ones. Lunch is on me if it passes.

How much do you think math is essential in engineering?,"I use math a lot. However I have never had a situation where I've had to sit down and do long hand calculus work on a sheet of paper without the aid of a PC. No company is going to waste engineering hours by not giving you some form of tools to do your job faster/easier. In fact over time you are going to develop or discover tools that are unique to your field that would speed up all that basic calculation work even faster. In the real world you will never have a closed book test. You will never have to do long form math on paper without a calculator, and everywhere you go you have access to nearly the entire world's knowledge in your pocket."

They are not above the law.  Please advocate for yourself too because other cowards will tell you to do nothing and allow the harassment to continue.  Write their names down, who their supervisor is. Get dates and times of when it happened and what was said and start voice recording or video recording and talk to a lawyer.  They wont say shit anymore about them being union.  You can contact their union rep too.  In fact get their lawyer to contact them.  And whoever told you that you can’t do anything because they are union.

Is this the end of JIT manufacturing?,"It's all about risk assessment.

I had a customer who had a million dollar machine.  I went to him and asked, ""How long can you afford to be down?""

He answered, ""I can't"".

""Ok, well here's the parts you need to make sure that doesn't happen, they have X, Y, and Z lead times.""

I then gave him a quote for roughly $80,000 dollars.

They hemmed and hawed and declined to get the parts.  Then?  The machine went down and it took 6 weeks for some of them to come in.  I had to be both empathetic and stern, because when their COO called me and asked why he should continue to use my equipment I reminded him, ""I made this recommendation to you 4 months ago.  I'm an expert and understand your equipment.  Maybe I failed in expressing how important this was, but I did give you all the information including how long lead times were.""

""Wait we knew how long it would be?""

""yes""

&#x200B;

That customer is my best aftermarket customer now by far.  He learned a valuable lesson on what risks were acceptable and what weren't.  He also learned very quickly where supply chain choke points were that were unacceptable.

The MBA and economist in me says that there will be a tremendous amount of efficiency that comes out of this whole pandemic.  The engineer in me says that there will be a whole lot of systems improvements."
"If 100% of cars were EVs, do we have enough power on the grid to charge them all at once?","Power system engineer here

Short answer: No, but it's because of transformer capacity. Not even if you charge at different times of the day

Transformers on the distribution system are usually sized to handle loads beyond their nameplate rating. Transformers can handle overloading for short durations. This could range from 30 minutes to an hour at 150% or even 200% nameplate. This differs by utility. However, this is only possible if the transformer has a chance to cool down for many hours afterwards.

So even if there is enough generation to power EVs charging at different times of the day, this doesn't give the distribution transformers the opportunity to cool down.

Transformers are sized to fit the need. Or else it would be uneconomical. So many transformers on the distribution are already operating close to capacity.

Utilities are foreseeing the increase in EVs and are hopefully adjusting their engineering philosophy accordingly. But this change will take time."

What’s the best thing about being an engineer?,"I just like building cool stuff and knowing how most things work. Obviously I also care about the impact of my work and whatnot, but at the end of the day I really love being the guy in the room that people ask when they need to understand basically anything physical."
How the hell do I get a job?,"Defense, gov, and energy are still hiring especially you're willing to relocate. My employer has been continuously hiring 5-10 new engineers per month(across all disciplines) for the last 3 years.

Edit:

Alright, I sent out a generic PM with info to anyone that was interested, if you didn't get one from me then feel free to message me again in case I missed it. And to clarify a bit when I said ""across all disciplines"" we are mostly talking electrical, mechanical, civil, software, computer-we don't do much with the specialized disciplines like biomedical or aerospace."
Is it worth learning Python as a Mechanical Engineer?,[deleted]
"Mechanical Engineers turned Software Engineers, what changed, and how did you do it?","I went to school for ME and work in Software.

Getting jobs in software is more skill based than degree based.  They have you take various programming tests and so don't care as much about your degree.  However, I did get a minor in CSci, which definitely helps.  You can get a Software job with pretty much any STEM degree, though, since they all teach some at least basic coding, and they'll test if you know enough for them in the interview.  If you have a STEM degree ""baseline"" and are self taught the rest of the way, you're good.

Personally, it was just about opportunity.  There are a TON of software jobs in many more diverse cities that all pay much more.  I don't care about the money as much, but staying in ME means limiting the number of job opportunities.  Out of college I probably applied to at least three times as many ME positions as software positions but got about the same number of ME and Software job offers.

Software is definitely much more flexible.  WFH is common everywhere now, but my company is still 100% WFH and will eventually go to a hybrid model.  I actually prefer in person, so this is a pro or con depending on you.

I want to be an ME again.  I am capable of doing software, but I'm passionate about ME and feel like I'm outside my element.  My current job is great right out of college, and allowed me to move to a new city, which would have been much harder as an ME.

You can talk about the logistics and pay all you want, but at the end of the day, I want to be an ME because I want to be an ME.  The technical content is very different, and there's a reason I spend 5 years studying to be an ME: because I enjoyed it and I want to be an ME.  I feel like engineers, and a lot of advice in this sub, is overly practical.  Most of us became Engineers because we enjoy it, but then seem to forget that and let money and logistic drive our careers instead of the simple fact that we enjoy Engineering."
What’s your most memorable/painful fuck up?,That doesn't seem like it's even remotely your fault
How do I become an actual engineer now when I fucked up in college?,"Sounds like you are having some anxiety. First thing you need to do is calm yourself, and stop shutting yourself down with a negative attitude. Being negative about your situation turns it into a self-fulfilling prophecy, and obviously you don't want that.

Instead, focus your energy on coming up with a plan to change your situation for the better. Figure out what ""next steps"" you have to take in order to accomplish your goals. When you hit a roadblock, get some exercise to take your mind off of your problems for a while. Trying to bang your head against it will make you worse off and less able to work up a solution.

Second, I find it very difficult to believe that you somehow passed through four years of an engineering program and learned *absolutely nothing.* I think what's more likely is that you weren't able to get a proper engineering job with good mentors to guide you during your formative years as an EIT, which is very important.

Don't worry — this is pretty common and you aren't the only one who got a less-than-ideal job straight out of school. What I am concerned about is that you apparently didn't try to get *any* kind of engineering or technical work after you graduated.

You'll need to explain this to me because I personally went through the same thing: graduated with a horrible GPA (2.6 if my memory serves) and zero internship experience... yet I was still able to get an engineering job. It took me 9 months, over 1,000 job applications, and suffering through horrible anxiety and depression — but I did it.

Here are my followups to you. I want you to answer them so I can help you better.

* Over the past 3 years, what has prevented you from looking for an engineering job?

Is there really this “strong” demand for self driving cars or is it just constant media fluff?,Maybe just a single use case but I'm hoping for full self-driving ability by the time I'm too infirm to drive safely (and there's a lot of those on the road currently!) - I get to keep my independence for longer without inflicting my poor driving on the rest of the populace!
Do you really have to change companies every 3-5 years to move up?,I have been with the same company for 15 years and have had many significant raises over the years. It all depends on the company.
Worried that my first job will prevent me from growing as an engineer,"I'm closing in on 27 years of experience here.  Believe me your 1st job won't hinder you in the slightest, you can find other ways in the path you choose, you just have to work for it.  

The skills you learn on trains apply to everything, from nukes, to spacecraft, cars, washing machines, etc.  Almost everything really.  Learn as much as you can, do what you can, get more education at the company's dime.  Just because you finished college doesn't mean you stop learning."
Does it get better?,"It's normal to have periods of stress in school, but if you're stressed all year long, you might want to slow down. Take fewer classes, take a semester off for a co-op, etc.


In the job market, take your pick. There are quiet, low-stress engineering jobs and there are high-intensity nail-biting ones.


Also, a big part of your stress level comes from intrinsic factors rather than the actual situation.  I recommend Sonia Lupien's books if you want to know more about stress."

Edit: I think we’ve got about all the constructive conversation out of this one that we will, so we’re locking it now."
Asking for experiences from other engineers who blew the whistle. What happened?,"There is no job worth compromising your ethics and morality. Period. 

That being said it does sound like you may be newer and not have a lot of experience. When I run things through testing I want to find all possible issues, however, it is complicated to communicate how products will be used/set up and can require some back and forth to make sure the test represents the use cases. I don't know what is happening here, the way you described the interactions with the previous engineer could be totally clean above board communication, or something very slippery. 

If you feel this is shady I would 100% raise the issue with your management verbally. If you are not satisfied with their response email your concerns to have it in writing. I would do it verbally first because if there is a totally reasonable explanation, you don't want to have a paper trail casting these kinds of thoughts. If there is anything smelly about it get it in writing immediately"
Is it very common to have significantly more work than you can realistically get to?,"Yes. I have years of backlog. You learn to prioritize and delegate (up and down).  In my last review I was told that I needed to improve my ability to separate urgent from critical. I laughed so hard, it’s absurd. But yes, you do what you can. You set the expectations wisely.

Edit: LOL the thing is, what I failed to mention was the specific instance in which the person made a comment about how I set priorities. The PE messes up my schedule and I have to fix it, at the same time as having a critical issue that can result in work stoppage for 2 people. I figured that since it was not my fault the schedule got messed up, I’m dealing with the issue that will have people sitting idle if nothing is fixed. The PE took offense that I had a critical issue to resolve when his problem was really urgent. 

It is my company policy that every time there is a review you must have an area of improvement. For years, my area of improvement was pretty much my attitude. This time my manager thought it be “funny” to have a “new” area of improvement. Hence critical vs urgent."
How do you guys stay focused in meetings? Is it normal to ignore the majority of meetings?,"These type of meetings, from my experience are there to give 'the wider picture' and to make you feel included in 'the wider picture'.

Most of the time the information is completely irrelevant and people at all levels shut off and just ignore anything that does not directly affect their day to day work.

There are many strategies for dealing with these type of meetings:

\- The most common is to completely shut off and day dream until it is your turn for the information dump. This is completely normal and almost everyone does it, from senior management to shop floor workers. You can day dream about anything, just don't get too engrossed and miss your turn.

\- Take notes. Write everything down. It makes you look keen and attentive, even if you are writing something completely irrelevant like rap lyrics or a novel.

More disruptive options:

\- Ask questions, ask them profusely, ask about everything. If you are there, and you have a question, make sure everyone hears it and it gets answered. Why is that sensor important, where is it getting used, are their diagrams, where are they stored? So many good questions. Keep asking, the meetings will drag on for hours. Most people will not like you for doing this, but it shows willing to the bosses, and if asked then you can respond 'aren't the meetings so everyone can understand / I was curious'. Best case, you don't get invited any more.

\- Develop an annoying habit. Make sure the habit is public and annoying, something like breathing loudly and weirdly or cracking your knuckles loudly if you can. Employ said habit throughout every meeting. Best case, you don't get invited any more

\- Stare at people. Choose someone randomly and stare at them and only them. Make them squirm under your gaze. Make sure you do this for the whole meeting, even when it is your turn to speak, address only them and perhaps mention them by name during your segment, 'Billy, I have been working on project A all week'. Make them feel special and uncomfortable. Best case, you don't get invited any more.

\- Take offense to things, small things and complain about them. Make people concerned about speaking because they might offend you, things like 'male to female connectors' or 'master slave communications' are a great place to start. You can focus this down to the minutiae or start researching suppliers for comments on their practices. Best case, you don't get invited any more.

\- Make a formal complaint about said meetings disrupting your working time. Express their irrelevance to your job, and make sure everyone knows and agrees with your opinion on their pointlessness. Make a business case for loss of profit for the company due to your time wasted in said meetings and make sure there are numbers. Use this as the basis of your complaint as manager types love numbers to argue with. Best case, you don't get invited any more or the meetings are stopped all together.

These are just some suggestions to keep yourself entertained during the meeting, you won't make friends doing them. My best advice is the first comment of daydreaming.

We all suffer the pointless information dump meetings, you have to find your way of keeping going through them.

I always used to mix a bit of the disruptive strategies with some daydreaming. Personally I like the questions method as it makes people think you are keen and interested, it also makes people wary of inviting you as they expect questions. The best way to pull this off without everyone hating you is to actually be keen and interested.

I drew maps of the factory, production processes and supply chain. Read all materials and datasheets on componentry and equipment. Read all relevant standards. I used these for the basis of questioning, and asked relevant and direct questions.

I got earmarked as 'keen and interested' and few people invited me to meetings unless they had to, which meant I could focus on the stuff that was relevant to my job. Ultimately leading to me performing better than anyone else in a similar job role.

edit: also if it is a design meeting, and you are proposing a design, bring a duck. Not a real duck but a metaphorical duck.

Do I need to be good at math for mechanical engineering?,"No one is born knowing how to walk or do math, they are skills both learnt through practice."
Finding a better purpose in engineering?,"I like the ""keeping the lights on"" social benefit of working for a power company, but the ME jobs here aren't very calculation-heavy. There are some calculations to dive into, but the procedures are established."
Becoming a high school teacher because of COVID?,"I think it would look better than retail, and would probably be more fulfilling. I wouldn't stay for too long, though (maybe a year or two); otherwise, employers might be hesitant to hire someone who's been out of the loop for an extended period of time. I wouldn't worry about your lack of experience. On the contrary, what you've learned gives you a lot of perspective that you can share with your students."
Lazy gossipy coworker gets paid more and has less time with the company than me. How should I ask for a raise? I appreciate anyone’s input or experience with this!,"Three things:

1. This guy is not you, and what he gets paid, and how he spends his time has NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU. You don't know why they decided to pay him that, and you don't know what he brings to the table. There is a guy at my office that literally sleeps sitting up in his chair for 3 hours a day. Gets paid an enormous amount, and when you ask him for help, he literally has no idea how to help you. But you know what? He has strong relationships to tons of people in the shipping industry and the contracts he negotiates once a year saves our company >$80million a year. Do you think the guy sitting next to him hates him? Sure. Do you think the company would pay double his salary if he demanded it? You better believe it.
2. You will NEVER get anywhere in a discussion with management comparing yourself to someone else in the office. Its not fair, its not professional, and in all likelyhood, its not accurate. If you believe you deserve a raise, categorize the things that you do for your company, come up with an effective and comparable job description, find online resources like payscale and glassdoor, price out the job you think you are doing currently, and make a bid that you deserve that salary based on YOUR VALUE.
3. You sound like you are very emotionally invested in your position and your relationship to your job. This is hard to avoid, but something you should really try to eliminate. Your company will NEVER love you back. You are there to provide a service for a fee, and you will be much happier with your work if you can keep that relationship at a distance. You will also be significantly more successful.

These are tough things that everyone has to face once in a while. I can tell you from experience that the cooler, more professional and analytical head you can keep on this, the better outcomes you can expect for yourself. Its really hard to do, but will be a favor to yourself.

Shouldn’t an engineer be told what to work on?,"My career has been based on side projects that nobody told me to do; I just decided to do them.

The fact that you aren't putting your name on them is good protection for you, but it wouldn't take a huge stretch to implicate you if you're one of the few people that write them. As always, making sure you have a trail of emails that show they are telling you to forge results is helpful. 

Honestly, forging results on a test report would be enough to make me quit and move on to another company, perhaps even to another industry. I couldn't stand saying our products were safe knowing that the results were faked.

If possible, I'd send an anonymous email to an OEM that you're selling parts to and tell them to test the parts they're receiving from you. In the case that a component they use is looked at for premature failure, they can come directly to you or your company."
"I like being an engineer, but my motivation is approaching absolute zero","I was in a similar situation, the whole company was a large room with 40 engineering drafting all day in silence for 9 hours a day. No one talked and it was completely draining. Make no mistake, most people crave social interaction. 

I switched to a new job at a much larger company and I am much happier; not only do I communicate all the time with people all over for work, but my area has a good group that spends time socializing. Some companies require and encourage socialization between employees, and I think you would benefit finding one that suits you."
Why aren't airplanes dimpled like golf balls?,"There are two main components to aerodynamic drag: pressure drag and skin friction. Pressure drag is due to pressure differential between front of an object and its wake region (back of the object). Skin friction is due to drag between object surface and fluid molecules. 

Due to shape of a sphere, large portion of golf ball's drag comes from size of the [wake](https://i.stack.imgur.com/hrI39.png), or the pressure differential between front and back side of the ball. Turbulent flow (caused by the added dimples) inherently results in higher skin friction on the ball, but it also reduces the wake size for the ball significantly by delaying flow separation. So in the case of a ball, the reduction in wake more than makes up for the higher skin friction due to the dimple. Another factor often overlooked is spin of the ball. Golf balls (when hit correctly) all have back spin, so the [Magnus effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_effect) comes into play and creates lift for the ball, allowing it to stay afloat longer. The dimpled surface allows longer flow adhesion over top of the ball compare to smooth ball, so it increases the Magnus effect for larger lift. 

In the case of a plane, its shape is already aerodynamic, so the wake size has been minimized from its shape. ~~Creating turbulent flow across~~ Air flow across surface of planes is also mostly turbulent already, so adding dimple to its surface does not significantly reduce wake size. But it does increase skin friction, and result in overall higher drag.

Did you prefer working in a big or a small company?,"At small companies, I’ve never had to spend an hour trying to get a menu from a sushi place in another state to justify that a $6 piece of salmon sashimi (鮭, *Sake*) was in fact food and not liquor on an itemized receipt for an expense report.

At big companies, I’ve never finished a years-long customer project and wondered if I’d have a job there in a month. (I did, but some coworkers had decided to bail before they got a definitive answer to that one.)

Ended up taking a job in a research group in a university, even though the pay is way worse. Here I get to really dive into projects, and work with technical improvements and optimisation. And since I'm not in charge of applying for funding, the only economical concerns I have is doing rough estimates for the stuff I need, and get it approved by our group leader before ordering it. Absolutely love it!"
"When an interviewer asks you ""What is your biggest weakness?"" How do you respond?","Before any job interview I always compare myself against requirements for the role. My current role means im managing a team, something id never done in a professional capacity. So when askwd this at the interview i started by explaining i had some management and leadership experience in non-work related activities but never in a professional sense so id consider that a potential area of weakness. I then said about how i had attended coaching and leadership courses in my previous job to get my base knowledge up tp scratch and that i felt i just needed experience.

"Who's ""that person"" at work, and what do they do?","In my experience, every super-essential person that I've worked with actually turned out to be quiet replaceable. Sure things don't work as well and time and money get wasted, but the world keeps spinning.

- you doing everything actually takes away learning opportunities from someone that doesn't know how to do it. Sure, it's going to take longer, and they might even mess it up. But, in the long run, they'll learn and then there will be two of you who can share the load. 

- the work will always be there. Whether you get all your stuff done today or not, there will always be more to do the next day. 

- you putting a little bit into everything means that, realistically, nothing is getting done 100% correctly. You might think that it is, at the cost of your burnout, but in reality, it's not. If you want things done correctly, you need to take your time in doing them, and that means not piling on a huge workload every day. 

- Cheesy as it sounds, prioritize your own health, mental and physical. You will do your job better and feel better doing it when you prioritize yourself. You want things done right? Include yourself on that list of things. Once you start slacking on taking care of yourself, it'll reflect in your work. Even if it's still good, it won't really be your best."

Why are Tesla car batteries made up of a bunch of tiny batteries (looks like AA battery) and not just one big battery?,"Another factor not mentioned: batteries have a fixed potential based on their electrochemistry (about 3.6V for li-ion). For a high power application you likely want more voltage than you can get from a single cell, because higher voltage means lower current. And the way you achieve that is by arranging multiple cells in series.

So even if you could make enormous battery cells inexpensively, you'd still likely make it out of multiple cells just to get the desired voltage."

An overachiever programmer is making our lives hell and we don't know what to do... how do you deal with people like this?,"He's not an over-achiever.  He's got really good at the front side (putting together a codebase fast) and you have neglected the backside of documentation, maintenance etc.

&#x200B;

Also you and your management are playing into it by only assigning tasks and listening to his estimates.

Escalate all his estimates at least 10-20% on the end for documentation and close out. Finally and here's the big thing they should schedule X hours a week for upkeep maintenance or other tasks on ""completed projects"" I think a lot of management forget that all code has a maintenance debt that needs to be paid.

&#x200B;

Sadly this is all pushed towards management where the problem lies. They think they are getting a deal when they get projects done twice as fast as any other dev but they don't realize he's just optimized it to push off his task to everyone else, they also find that 10x types that can answer any question can work faster but if you put them min the middle of a team they can answer everyone's questions and make 10 people 1.5X faster  instead of them googling half a day or whatever to find an answer. which is a better use of their time. However they tend not to like it as they end up being in baby sitting and problem solving mode than crunch time.

&#x200B;

My only suggestion is highlight some of this to management or try to pad your own schedules around it.

Did ancient Roman aqueducts have shut-off valves or diverters between the source and the settling tank at the city? How would ancient engineers deal with the flow of water if there was a breakage or a need for repairs?,"The Roman aqueducts sometimes had diverters and by adjusting the diverters to a full flow one way or the other, the flow could be heavily diverted.  These diverters existed closer to cities (think the point of entry).  There are also historical accounts of two major failures that were cured by the installation of temporary lead pipes.  


Not to minimize your question, but much of the aqueduct system is at grade or underground, so repairs weren't commonly necessary, it was more important to clean calcium deposits or algae.  The overhead portions collapsed on a handful or historic occasions due to earthquakes, but this wasn't common.  


If a diverter or lead piping wasn't available, it would be easy enough to physically block up the aqueduct and allow the water to overflow.  


Hope it helps."

Really freaked out and intimidated to apply/work for legit companies,"> I feel like it’s all just surface level knowledge

That's because it IS all just surface level knowledge.

Let's both pretend for a minute that we never studied engineering, and let's engage in this simple thought exercise:

An engineer who's been working at a company for 20 years, probably well-versed in what the company does, has a position in middle management, is very good at solving problems related to his company's function. Let's say his company manufactures mechanical components like nuts and bolts.

Now take him and put him in a company that does not manufacture nuts and bolts; let's say this company designs (but does not manufacture) wiring harnesses for residential appliances like refrigerators and dishwashers.

How do you think this guy is going to perform on Day 1 of his new job? Closer to a new graduate, or closer to a 20-year guy?

My point is, your studies give you a foundation, a basic understanding of the concepts that will help you *learn* what you need in your career. There's no way that four years of schooling can give you the type of knowledge and experience that our 20-year guy has in his field; that's not the intent.

Keep studying and learning as much as you can. Learn the ins and outs of how heat transfer works, fluids, thermo (for example), etc. Then, when you're on the job learning how to design a heat exchanger for a power plant, you'll have a foundational understanding of these concepts that will help you understand how heat exchanger design works - even though you may have never actually designed a heat exchanger.

tl;dr - You don't have any idea what you're doing because you haven't learned it yet, but that's normal. Don't sell yourself short. You'll get there."

It's good to keep a record of your time if you get audited, or if you get a prickly program manager asking you why you charged hours on something.

Why are an airliner's engines mounted to the bottom of the wing?,"EDIT 2: I'm glad so many people appreciated this explanation of lift. If anyone wants a more detailed description of the curvature effect then I would strongly recommend reading [this paper ""How do wings work?"" by Holger Babinsky](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0031-9120/38/6/001/pdf?casa_token=B1HJhFGDW8QAAAAA:ho3sR0JFfhKDXejAVvS1gQGzNkNLpHGusizQkZ8iZ7o2M1PXhras-COGdDKsLTv6TP81-uiwOw) which goes into a bit more detail ([google scholar search with pdf link if that one doesn't work](https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=holger+babinsky+how+do+wings+work&btnG=&oq=how+do+wings)), but is very much meant for the lay person with only a basic understanding of fluid mechanics and contains a lot of helpful figures. In fact I think it is essential reading even for experienced aerodynamicists or indeed anyone with an interest in aerospace engineering. The first two paragraphs of my comment  mostly summarise the paper.

So first of all that explanation of lift, although commonly quoted along with the paper example, is pretty wrong. I'm not sure where it first came from but there's really  no reason why a packet of air moving over the tip of the wing would have to meet up with any other packet moving underneath. There's a few different ways you can explain lift, such as due to downwards momentum flux from the wings deflecting air or from circulation produced by the wing. My preferred explanation is due to curvature. When any fluid moves in a curved path the inside of the curve must have a lower pressure than the outside to allow for the necessary centripetal force. The air moving over the top of the wing therefore curves in a way that produces a low pressure, while on the bottom it curves to produce a high pressure. Bernoulli's principle is actually in play here as the flow will speed up or slow down accordingly, but not in a way that necessitates that air ""meets up"" at the trailing edge. Ultimately all of the explanations describe the same physics, just using different mathematical constructs.

I'll add that the example you give with paper is also often misinterpreted. Blowing over the top of the paper will only cause it to lift if you hold it horizontally such that it sags. If you hold it vertically so that it hangs straight down and blow parallel to one side then it won't move to that side, nor would it move down if you blew on the bottom when holding it horizontally as you might expect if the pressure was lower due to faster moving air. This comes down to a misunderstanding of Bernoulli's principle, it isn't that ""faster moving fluids have lower pressure"" it is that the [total pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_pressure) is constant (in ideal cases without heat flux and friction). If you just blow air from your mouth then the jet will have the same static pressure as the surrounding air. The reason the paper lifts up when you blow over the top is again due to curvature. [The Coandă effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coandă_effect) means the jet of air curves around with the paper, meaning the fluid at the top surface now has a lower pressure than on the bottom and so it lifts. You'd notice that the paper cannot remain horizontal when doing this as there would be no curvature to produce lift.

Now to get onto why engines aren't mounted on top of the wings, there are a number of reasons. Aerodynamically it probably wouldn't be beneficial. Although there are [some  aerodynamic benefits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_layer_control)  to blowing air onto the wing, and [it is done in some cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blown_flap), doing so with the whole engine would probably hurt overall wing performance due to the disruption to the flow at the leading edge. It could also hurt engine performance as if the wing disrupts flow into the engine then the compressor and fan could lose efficiency and the distortion could cause stress problems in the blades. Structurally it would be less stable having the engine on top, imagine trying to hold a heavy weight above your head rather than letting it hang by your arm. Maintenance is easier with the engine on the bottom and you also get less noise in the cabin as the wing can block some of it.

I’m a 17 year old girl. How do I make this my career?,"1. You absolutely can be an engineer. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. 
2. Engineering, at a glance, is people solving real world problems using principles of Math, Science, and Physics. Once you start to learn more you'll see that engineering as a field is incredible diverse. 
3. You could be designing bridges, roads, sewers, apartment buildings, schools, high rises, cars, aircraft, boats, computers, cameras, refrigerators, microwaves, radios, microphones, televisions, street lights, semi truck, oil tanker trailers, oil and gas pipelines, fertilizer production facilities, plastic production facilities, open pit copper mines, underground salt mines, hairspray manufacturing lines, cell phone assembly lines, automated bottle filling lines, and so much more. And that's just Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, and Mining Engineering. 
4. If you'd like additional resources on how things, like computer monitors, aluminum cans, etc. are made and also some commentary of why certain engineering decisions are made, have a look at The Engineer Guy on youtube. https://www.youtube.com/user/engineerguyvideo/videos?flow=grid&view=0&sort=p

Advice for Negotiating Salary?,"I agree with @AParanoidEmu, you have a good chance of upping this number. I'd get a copy of the school's statistic on the $72,500 to back it up at the negotiating table.  I'd counter offer with higher than $72,500 myself.

If you have higher than average GPA or if you had internships involved in AE, **definitely go higher than the average**!  

If the average of $72,500 is OK with you, you can let yourself be negotiated down to that or even to $70K if that's acceptable to you (I don't know why it would be).  

Also know what amount you will walk from (walk from the negotiation entire with a ""Sorry, but buh-bye, no deal"").  There is always such a level - personally I'd put the walk-away threshold at $72,500 but I'm a risk-thriving person, always had internships and high GPA in school, etc.

Other tips - sorry, yet another Wall of Text:

All negotiations have a similar structure and set of rules.  Basically you have a ""game"" played with each side having a turn with 3 options:

* Stay in the game, accept offered bid, game ends
* Stay in the game, make counter-bid (including a null-bid, same-as-last-time), game continues
* Get out of the game (walk away), game ends

This is bootstrapped by a opening bid made by one of the two sides.  The game iterates until the game ends.  BTW ALL economic transactions and romantic/sexual relationships are also negotiations exactly the same as this.  Something to think about if you aren't getting laid regularly or if you are in a bad relationship.

All you have to do is know what you are willing to accept, counter or walk from.  These are determined by stakes (pay, benefits, commitments, etc.) and resource levels (your time to play the game and money opportunity cost of playing).  You should always enter any negotiation knowing what these thresholds are ahead of time.  

You can determine the thresholds based on 

1. comparables (what others that are ""comparable"" are paid) - like how houses are initially bid, or

2. your own financial needs (cost-based pricing, your cash flow costs and obligations) which usually ""leaves money on the table"" in their favor

3. your intuition and opinion of what you are worth and what you think they will accept (""what the market will bear"" which is not ""provable"" except empirically but is just as reasonable as anything for a negotiation - you have to be brave enough to be able to ""walk"" based on your intuition/opinion about this) - this is actually the maximizing solution and also the one that requires the most knowledge/research and risk.

The party *offering money* (aka Buyer) should always *low-ball* their initial offer and counter-offers.  The party *offering non-money* (aka Seller) should always *high-ball* their initial offer and counter-offers.  This has to do with the fungibility of money over pretty much all else - it's bias in the power relationship. 

It also is the only way for both parties to find the deal ""intuitively/emotionally acceptable""; go in the ""wrong direction"" and ""non-monotonic counter-offer progression"" and there will be ""sour grapes"" on one side even after the deal is closed which will often cause problems down the road.

Also related to this: the point is *not* to close the negotiation quickly.  This actually both signals, and is in fact an indication of, a side's situational/negotiation weakness.  Aka ""Blood in the water"".  You have time (unless you don't) so having several iterations of the above game is a good thing.  

In other words, your 1st counter offer *should be obviously unacceptable* with the expectation it will be rejected **and trigger a counter-offer but not a ""walk away""** on their side: above the Buyer's ""Reasonable Zone"" but below the Buyer's ""Insult Zone"" in the Buyer's ""Credible Zone"" (see PDF below).  The ""Insult Zone"" is where a side is jarred to the point where they realize they are wasting their time playing the game and should walk away (quit).

And the $66K should be obviously unacceptable to you - nearly in if not in your ""Insult Zone"".  I'd say $80K is still in the Buyer's Credible Zone, possibly in the high Reasonable Zone.  I'd guess the $66k is actually the Buyer's ""Top Line"" offer.

So you iterate with their offer to your counter offer (and assuming they reject $80K): 

---

""So you won't do $80K.  What can you offer that is better than $66K.  BTW, the recent historic salaries of MSAE graduates from my school has **averaged** $72,500.""

*lay a print-out of the schools statistics on the table*  

""I've had internships between terms which means I have more experience that your *average* graduate.  I also have a very good, above *average* GPA.""

*lay your resume on the table*  

""So I while my $80K number is quite fair IMO, what can you do instead?""

And they counter-counter-offer with a new number (the game continues, now with them having the idea that your ""Bottom Line"" is closer to $72,500) or they ""null"" counter offer (""we can't go above $66K"").  Again, what is **your** ""walk away"" threshold?  I'd definitely walk at this point unless there are significant non-money things they can counter with, but that's me.

So consider asking/proposing for things that aren't cash money to pad you initial or counter offers (especially if they null offer below your walk away threshold).  This could include benefits or it could be vacations or sabbaticals or trade/academic conference trips or perks a nice window office and an equipment budget.

""OK so you can't go above $66K.  I really liked the folks I interviewed with and it seems like a good work environment, but I can't accept that salary.  Maybe there are other benefits you can offer to make up for the gap in your salary offer.  ""  

*This is a not subtle dig (and quite intentional, but nicely framed) which they should pick up on and put them on the defensive, at least in their minds.  They want to be liked because you just said you liked them BUT - you put the BUT in their mouths based on what they said/offered which says they are not reciprocating with your liking them.  You may pick up on it in body language.  Being put on the defense will cause them to agree to things they may not normally agree or plan to; that's a good thing.  Just get it in writing.*

""You normally offer 2 weeks of vacation per year after a 6 month probation period: how about we nullify the probation completely and you give me 4 week of vacation per year immediately.  That works out to $2640 extra per year effectively.""

*That bumps you up to $68,640 right there.  Their objection will be that the ""salary curve doesn't allow that"" to which you can say ""So let's make a new position, title and salary curve then"" which BTW I've had done for me in the past!!  It is possible but it requires imagination and authority on their part - another possible ""walk away criteria"".  I used 50 weeks because that's when you'd normally be working for them productively with 2 weeks vacation.  But before they can answer...*

""There are 3 professional conferences I'd like to regularly attend.  If you guaranteed my annual attendance with hotel, transportation and meals for myself *and my wife/SO*, that would be another $6K per year.  I'd be willing to pick up the expenses for my wife other than the hotel, transportation and meals, of course.""

*Obviously you need to be prepared for all of this with your own numbers. It's like studying for an exam you'd actually like to pass, right?  Did you notice the sleight-of-hand on getting your wife/SO covered?  Of course the ""extra expense"" both quite reasonable and costing you nothing but it only seems fair to include the other things for her since she is affected by their offer gap also and they need to make up the gap in their offer somehow.*

""And to really do my job here well, I'd really need to have the new Acme Boundary-layer Characterization System 5000 in my lab and plenty of computing power to drive the analysis.  If you could provide that I have one of those, say, within the next 2-3 months, and give me a $200K/year capital budget, I could ignore the remaining difference in salary from what I think is perfectly reason and acceptable as an industry norm.""

*Get this in writing also.  And the benefit to them is that they get to keep the Acme 5000 and any capital anyway and it help them with a productivity issue.  So it doesn't actually cost them and might be nearly a sunk cost anyway.  But it will make your work life so much easier and more pleasant.*

There are so many negotiation tricks I'm using above I can't really gory detail them here.  Get a copy of [Cohen](http://www.amazon.com/You-Negotiate-Anything-Herb-Cohen/dp/0553281097) and [Caldini](http://www.amazon.com/Influence-Psychology-Persuasion-Robert-Cialdini/dp/0688128165), read them, think about this situation in the context of these books.  Also look at this [negotiation PDF](http://ormediation.com/uploads/Meeting_02_Negotiation_and_Mediation_Club_v1.pdf), especially the ""7 secret weapons"" (from Caldini IIRC).  

Get these non-money things in writing as part of closing the deal.  Ideally in the final offer letter or in a written employment agreement your write for them yourself if they won't write it in or they wiggle with ""we can handle this later"".

If they throw out the idea of a formal written agreement to the extras then minimally write a ""letter/memorandum of understanding"" that says the same basic thing and certified mail it to them.  If you have a friend who's a lawyer, ask him/her to send it to the company for you on firm letterhead.  

A MOU/LOU of understanding isn't as strong as a contract but it does have significant legal standing so you can at least use it as a negotiating tool later on if you need to - particularly if they go back on the agreed terms and you need to bitch-slap them to get them back on track.

She should be debarred for life by the FDA and aggressively prosecuted by DoJ.

You will encounter (hopefully much lesser) examples of this in your career.

How long did it take you to “get it” at a new job?,"Hi,

I wanted to first start this by saying you're not alone in how you feel, and the fact that you are getting your work done is a great indicator that you are in fact qualified for this job and are, at bare minimum, meeting expectations.

&#x200B;

Compare the pace and work type in this job to your previous, are they the same? if not, you don't actually have 2.5 years of experience in this field, you are a new candidate. Does that change how you feel about your performance in the role? It should.

&#x200B;

You are most likely coming into these projects with no prior knowledge, nothing to compare them to or reference from. People who have worked in your company for a longer time may see a project and be immediately able to relate it to a task they did some time ago, that immediately gives them some inside information.

&#x200B;

Are you organized? If you have 15 projects floating in your brain at once, of course you are going to feel overwhelmed. If you have clear distinctions between them, created by proper organization, time management, even things as simple as storing the documents in separate folders, you will feel better.

&#x200B;

Regarding your feelings, I would recommend making sure you are taking care of your physical health. People don't understand that staying fed, hydrated, and sleeping well play such a huge role in your body's ability to function. 

&#x200B;

If you're genuinely concerned about your performance, talk to your manager. Don't tell him you don't think you're doing enough etc., ask for his feedback/how you can improve (6 months in a role is a great time to do this because you should be settled in and they should have some levels of your ability). My guess is he will have a few minor pointers, but as a whole, you're doing great. 

I'm not trying to discount your feelings, as they are **your** feelings, but remember, people are typically their own harshest critic.

In the words of comedian Christopher Titus

Is that you, Loan Street CEO??

Pretty sure I'm gonna leave the post up, but please nobody here personally harass anyone working at Loan Street, or OP for that matter.

edit: to be clear, the mod team leaving this post up is not an endorsement of the OP's claims. For all we know, he's full of shit and Loan Street is correct. Definitely take the claims in the OP with a grain of salt, since you haven't seen the other side. It's staying up because there haven't been any subreddit rules broken, from what we can see."

That means no one cares if I go grocery shopping in the afternoon or I take an extra long lunch.  But also sometimes I have to work late to meet a deadline or fix a production issue.

EDIT:  some people seem to think this means people are all working weird hours most of the time, that's not what I meant.  Our company has mostly working hours of 9-5ish, with engineers often choosing to put in a couple hours extra here and there in the evenings so they can do stuff during the day.

80% of the time I can ping someone on slack and they're working normal hours, maybe 10% of the time they're out running an errand or eating and I get a msg like ""i'll be back at my computer in 20-30 min let's chat then"".  


We mostly work 9-5, but if someone has to pick up a kid from school or get their car worked on or do grocery shopping its not a problem as long as they get their work done, and the expectation is if there's a page in the night or a real deadline people will work in the evening on those rare occasions."

On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from [Apollo](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/) to [Reddit is Fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/13wxepd/rif_dev_here_reddits_api_changes_will_likely_kill/) to [Narwhal](https://www.reddit.com/r/getnarwhal/comments/13wv038/reddit_have_quoted_the_apollo_devs_a_ridiculous/jmdqtyt/) to [BaconReader](https://www.reddit.com/r/baconreader/comments/13wveb2/reddit_api_changes_and_baconreader/).

Even if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface .

Here's few things I am telling junior developers in 1:1 and it's working out pretty well,My issue personally is being scared to waste other people’s time with my questions.
Let's stop 100k+ salary posts,"I talk about salary so that the underpaid person can see what they’re worth and know what they can go get. I was that person once. If it weren’t for people talking about pay, I wouldn’t have seen mine grow so much."
"F it, I’m quitting",Cant personally relate but my brother is an attorney and took a big pay cut to leave a toxic job and is way happier.
A recruiter from Tesla reached out and I cannot believe what this sh*tcan of a company expect from applicants.,That was the workaholic test to see if you will submit to working 80hrs/w for Elon once hired.
Does the job search make anyone else want to cry?,"Stop applying to high stakes 250k/yr jobs. Apply to be a software dev for an insurance company or a bank; you'll make 100-150k a year and probably won't have to do leetcode in the interview. This is not a difficult field to get a job in if you look in the right places and you don't expect FAANG-level comp.

EDIT: also, get in touch with recruiters from big staffing firms like TEKSystems. They can land you a mediocre contract gig as a software dev in no time at all, and that can hold you over for 6 mos. to a year before you land a better gig somewhere else.

This sub suffers from a severe amount of melodrama from people who don't get FAANG jobs and think their career in tech is over. Widen your search and you'll be fine."
"Landed my dream job, Android developer, the employer and I just signed the job offer! Bought the plane ticket, gave my two weeks! then they rescinded my job offer.","This happened to me as well. A generous offer was rescinded after I was told I had the job by multiple managers.  Luckily because I'm paranoid by nature I didn't submit my 2 weeks notice, checking my email daily for an offer letter. These types of situations are painful and its gonna take you a couple weeks to get back to normal. You may think that you will never find your dream job but keep your head up, and an even better job will be knocking on your door in a few months. Stay positive!"
Should we start refusing coding challenges?,"Lol, I unironically did this accidentally. A company I did a first round with sent me a coding challenge. I said ""I'll do this in the next two weeks."" Two weeks rolls by and they ask if I did it, and I replied ""Got busy, I'll do it this week."" A week later they ask again and I said, ""I'll definitely do it in the next week."" Another week passes and they said, ""Don't worry, you don't need to do the challenge."" I said, ""Oh sorry, I really did mean to do it but I just accepted an offer."" The funny thing is I absolutely did mean to do the challenge, but just never found the time."

I threw in my two weeks notice and starting applying. Half my team did the same thing. Ended up landing a job that pays 20% more, gives an extra 2 weeks PTO, and its fully remote until the end of this year. Then we only need to go to the office twice a week and we get 6 weeks time that can be used to work remotely. Fuck the companies that want to control you. There are better ones out there.

> ***Public figures can be an exception to this rule***, such as posting professional links to contact a congressman or ***the CEO of a company***. But don't post anything inviting harassment, don't harass, and don't cheer on or upvote obvious vigilantism.

I consider all of the individuals mentioned to be public figures, for the purposes of the above rule. There's nothing particular in this post that is inviting harassment of the individuals, and y'all seem to be behaving yourselves in the comments for the most part. There's a lot of good discussion and advice happening in the comments.

I consider LinkedIn profiles to be ""professional links to contact [subject]"". If y'all don't want your LinkedIn to be used for that, set it to private. This does not invite harassment of particular individuals -- and if you're seeing this thread fixing to message the leadership mentioned in this thread, don't. Don't do that. That's how you get this community restricted, and force mods to instate a blanket ban of this style of thread."

Lots of people will not be able to break in and of those that do, some will find out tech is not for them. Imagine, this is already at a sub like r/learnprogramming so you'd assume this is already a higher rate. Though to be fair, I would assume it's more that people at r/learnprogramming are closer to self taught / bootcamp than being CS degree holders.

One other thing, I definitely believe many people can code but that they need mentors to guide them because this is a field where it is easy to get stuck and not everyone has the personality that can self learn when that happens. Many of the self taught I know are strong self learners who persist through blockers in one way or another."

What is your unethical CS career's advice?,"Getting promoted is 30% doing work worthy of getting promoted and 70% making sure the right people have a positive perception of the quality of your work.

You will find that both extremes are bad: you will run into people who do jack shit and are always trying to make themselves looks like rockstar by just talking a lot, and you will find people who are running entire organizations by themselves who never advocate for themselves.

The right/fair balance is somewhere in the middle, but the most efficient allocation of time is heavier on the advocating for yourself side."
Stop asking if a CS degree is worth it if you are young and haven't started college yet,">How are you going to get the interviews? Your resume, assuming you put a lot of effort into making it look good, will always look like shit compared to even people who went to a boot camp let alone got a CS degree and are competing for that entry level job as well.

I wanted to piggyback on this a bit.

Yes, a lot of people get jobs in tech through pathways other than a CS degree.  The point that misses is that none (or very, very few) of those people had a pathway that was self-teaching straight out of high school.

Very commonly, self-taught developers and boot camp grads are going to have several of:

* an entry-level degree in something other than CS
* an advanced degree in something other than CS
* 5-10 years of professional work experience
* an existing network with good contacts including people in tech
* a spouse with stable income for financial support

The salient point here being that people who get a tech job without a CS degree are typically mid-career professionals already and probably went to college.  People can do what they want, but to throw out a number I wouldn't consider skipping a CS degree unless I already had at least three things on that list."
A year ago I graduated from a bootcamp with 21 other people. Only 6 of us are working as SWEs today.,It's really impossible for me to imagine someone who's not a genius going from 0 to 100 in 3 months and being employable. There's a big caveat that's left out and it's that there is still a lot of self-study required outside of the course. I think if you are well-prepared and well-studied on your own you will have better odds coming out of a bootcamp.

Honestly for right now I think the best thing to do is understand that the pendulum of “equality” is swinging, and right now we’re in a far swing where people now feel the need to OVERcompensate for the lack of women, and over recognize women in STEM fields, going so far as to now single them out in a “positive” way, but in doing that makes us feel even worse because we feel that gender is the only reason we were hired. Eventually, as more women voice their issues then the pendulum will level out! Hang in there, know that you’ve got people on your side, and vent when necessary.

Edit: I’m so glad this sparked a productive discussion! I wanted to clarify a few points that I’ve noticed in some replies: If you’re given a platform above others, you should use it for good. If companies are hiring women for diversity alone, and that encourages more women(who may be better qualified) to apply, then it is A solution. Do I think that’s the best solution? No. But it is a solution, and if I’m being honest I’m sure I’ve benefited from that exact process. I’ve had 3 internships, and maybe it was imposter syndrome, but I’m fairly certain I was hired for at least one of those just so the company could boast that “50% of our mechanical interns are female!” (Spoiler, there were only 2 mech interns). But I used that position to encourage other girls to get into the field. Do I think it’s fair that females are only being hired for their gender, over potentially more qualified male candidates? Absolutely not. But that’s how companies are hiring, so it’s our responsibility to work with it to the best of our abilities and hopefully that pendulum will even out for the next generation of stem!"
"As a minority/POC, I am tired of seeing ""woke"" changes by corporations but not actual changes to fight against racism.","I agree with everything especially the name part.

A friend of mine named Mohammed actually changed his name to Mo in all his applications because he wasn't getting any call backs. I laughed at him because I found it ridiculous. I kid you not this guy got alot of interviews after. I don't know if that is a coincident.

Big M is letting employees work from home permanently,"I think Microsoft was like this to begin with, just wasn't an official policy or anything. My dad works at Microsoft and he works from home a lot even before COVID19 (I'd say he spends 50% of the time in the office or even less than that tbh) because he doesn't like commuting to work due to the traffic."
Just so we're clear! Working remote during a pandemic isn't the same as working remote in principle!,"I'd also like to add that many people have a family which would normally be at their own work or school, but in the current situation, they are also in the house while you are trying to work. Normal WFH situation you'd be alone in the house.

"People who physically touch the screen and leave your slug trail from your greasy sausage fingers when pointing things out, why do you do this?","Back in the days of CRT monitors I used to own a polarizing filter that was mounted in front of the screen. The thing improved my viewing experience enormously but not in the way you might think. You see, that filter came with a grounding wire that you were supposed to attach to a metal part of the chassis or some other source of ground. I soon discovered that if you failed to do that a wonderful thing happened. The filter would amass a high level of static charge and your fucktard colleague who tried to smear the surface with his KFC fingers would get a zap of a lifetime. Most learned their lesson after a single shock and amazingly some even learned purely from the suffering of others and not once dared to touch my screen.

For those of you who were bad at explaining things and got better, how did you do it?","visuals and examples can explain most of the concept. Otherwise, you'll just have to keep explaining the topic to them at more increasingly simple levels. You also might wanna fill them in on important points to understand that prerequisite to the topic you are trying to explain. Typically I find that people usually have the building blocks to understand what you're trying to explain, they just have a hard time connecting ideas together.

task: explain a singly linked list

1.) refer to the nodes as ""legos"" as they they behave in a similar manner. Legos can only connect on one side, much like how nodes can only connect in one direction

2.) relate the linked list to as a bunch of connected legos, a linked list is a collection of connected nodes, or more plainly put as a collection of collected legos.

3.) elaborate how the nodes are not indexed like an array, the nodes only have access to the next node. This is much like how a lego cannot simply connect to the nth lego, it must connect to the next lego, which connects to the next lego, and the next, and so on.

4.) explain how to add at the head of the list by setting the node-next to the current head, then moving the head pointer to the new node. This is like adding a lego to the top of a stack of legos, you connect the new lego to the top lego piece, then relabel the ""top"" piece as the newly added lego.

5.) explain how to remove at the head of the list by moving the head pointer and returning the previous head. This is like taking a lego off the top of a stack of legos, and relabeling the new ""top"" lego.

&#x200B;

what this explanation just achieved:

I just attempted to associate linked lists and nodes to lego stacks and lego bricks. This provides a familiar visualization for the person to more easily understand how pointers are manipulated using the idea of ""connecting legos"". This visualization not only helps to familiarize the concept, but simplifies the idea of pointer manipulation into a more understandable idea. This also helps to introduce the idea of pointers through their association with ""lego connections"" which is essential to understand how the head and next pointers are moved and assigned throughout the linked list.

&#x200B;

TLDR; Visualize, simplify, then explain"

Imo the industry needs to care about things more than technical skills alone. Stop hiring assholes simply because they can code. If you're making a 300k investment in an engineer, it's probably not too much to ask to ensure that they have a decent WLB. Doesn't have to be 40 hrs, but something reasonable."

Unpopular Opinion : Actual machine learning work is not nearly as fun as people think it is.,"If machine learning was packaged and sold as ""applied statistics,"" most undergraduates would think it's a boring as **** topic of study. Yet, that's exactly what it is. A ""machine learning scientist"" is more or less a computational statistician. A ""machine learning engineer"" is more or less a data engineer who understands statistics. The term ""machine learning"" is just a form of branding, as the word ""learning"" implies *intelligence*, which computers presently *do not* have.

That said, it's disingenuous to equate AI with machine learning. This is because AI is really more about the *application* than the *method*. Cutting edge natural language processing is currently done via statistical models. But natural language processing is so much more than statistics. Robotics is a combination of control theory & computer vision, both of which are built on top of statistical models; but that doesn't stop it from being genuinely ""cool.""

The trouble with machine learning - or applied statistics as I prefer to think of it - in industry is that it's typically employed for boring problems with boring solutions, like targeted advertisement or retail analytics. Don't blame the method - blame the application."
5 pieces of advice I wish I had known before taking random CSCQ advice,[deleted]
Shoutout to all the senior developers who really help and are patient with juniors,"shoutout to the juniors who put in the effort to understand stuff and ask good questions when stuck, and are honest about needing help.

There is no point in being dishonest working on software, the programs you write don't care about your lies.  If you get stuck on something, explain what you've tried and ask for help.

Don't just say everything is fine at standup when it isn't.  

Also Don't submit a pull request thinking nobody will notice the problem. Lol

It is the hardest thing to ask for help, i certainly did both of those things as a junior dev even knowing it was a dumb thing to do.  Once you get more experience and start reviewing other's code you will wonder why it was so hard to ask."

About number 5. Don't forget to not sound arrogant. I know quite a few people who are really good, but are just too full of themselves. They come into interviews and make it sound like they are the best thing out there.

And there are some class notes and TA notes from MIT and Berkeley among others that have high quality content on advanced topics."
Start applying months BEFORE you graduate. Not months after.,"To add on, companies know students' schedule. They know you need to finish school before you start working. If they're recruiting at colleges and posting ""new grad"" positions, then they're generally happy to interview you for the role and sign you with the expectation you start after you graduate. 

Big Tech starts recruiting literally up to 12 months before they expect you to start, they'll open new grad positions around August-September for start dates the following summer/fall.

You can still have this. A lot of places are happy to set your start date in the fall and you can take the summer off."
I was offered money to get a job for someone else,$200/interview is a way lowball amount for something like this. You should get at least 20% of their first year’s salary. Recruiters get 20% and they do less work than this.

I DON'T wanna be an asshole but I've had it with the new guy after 3 months,"I would just start sending emails of hey this needs to be done on X day, and copying your manager.

We still need two things done a certain time to keep up with our Sprint / timeline.

I'm not sure about you but our company has a 90-day trial period, maybe it's not too late? Just try to get everything in writing so your manager knows how much of a POS he is"

How about you suggest a consensual implementation (e.g. after sending the message, the other user receives a notification to choose whether or not to take and send a picture, like reverse snapchat or something).

Why people in StackOverflow is so incredibly disrespectful?,This question has already been answered. I'll mark this as duplicate.
A tip based on my experience: your interpersonal skills are probably more important than technical ability for career development,"This is something that many people tend to forget. Soft skills are important.

Good soft skills can make up for a lack of technical knowledge, but strong technical knowledge can not make up for poor soft skills. You need a minimum level of soft skills to have a chance in the job market. If you don't have that level, you need to train it. Sometimes I wish people took soft skills as serious as they did leetcode problems.

I'm one of those people that had to learn this the hard way. I've struggled for a long time to get a job despite having some excellent technical skills. Time and time again managers have told me ""we think you're really smart, but you need to improve your communication"". I've improved a lot in this area and I'm now a much easier person to work with."

12. If you really hated your job and it affected your mental peace, don’t immediately jump to another one. Take a month off and do a retrospective. In fact try to find out what made you hate it - was it the work or the people or office politics etc. Once you know these, analyze what your mistakes were - were you careless or just lazy or didn’t take up an opportunity to improve your situation. Write them down and try to not repeat them again. Being in a bad job is like a mini PTSD and you need to fix that before you move on.

"""Entry Level"" labeled jobs on LinkedIn are requiring 5+ years of experience in listing. What does Entry level even mean anymore?","I have two suspicions as to why:

1. ""Entry level"" as a label from the posters perspective puts the job in the widest margin and since many others do it they may feel that their job listing will miss out on some good candidates by not following suit. A sort of self fulfilling prophecy.

2. I've heard many times the requirements for a job are a wishlist more than actual requirements. So, a job where they are really hoping for 1-3 yrs experience becomes 5-8 instead. Sort of like the speed limit where 30 means 35 except backwards. 

As a May 2020 grad, I feel your pain. I've gotten a couple of bites that I'm currently pursuing and none were ""new grad"" or ""entry level"". They are junior/associate jobs that asked for 1-3 yrs experience but I applied anyway and I happened to fall into the margin of acceptance.

Thoughts and Lessons from a 22 Year Career in Tech,"One caveat is that if they topped your offer there won’t be any offer other than say vacation days. Say you asked 100-120 and they gave 130, probably best to not negotiate since that’s the intention."
You probably shouldn't get a PhD,"I mean if your goal is just money, and you aren't going to a top grad school for an industry relevant area of research, than yeah. Everyone knows there is opportunity cost. 

But some people want to become professors and keep doing research, and there are also other jobs that are only available to PhDs. People have different motives."
Here's why you dont get a chance to match their offer,"Just don't burn bridges. None of this is personal. Leave gracefully. You can tell them you didn't feel valued or that you would be properly compensated, but leave the anger at home when they give you the exit interview.

Look at it this way. If you act like an ass during your last moments, they can rationalize that they dodged a bullet getting rid of you instead of them feeling bad for losing an asset that brought value well beyond your cost. That is if I am reading you correctly and you want them to feel like they made a mistake.

The best outcome though is that they all are still part of your professional network. You don't know who dictates the culture there. You could alienate someone who shares your perspective and who eventually leaves the company and goes to a company where you would love to work and which is better at compensating the best contributors."

How do you deal with coworkers like this?,"I read this on an another post - 
A good manager will assign individual project to these over working engineers. So this engineer can progress without stepping on other people's toes and company takes advantage as well by getting a lot more work done. 
This will keep the team happy with people who wants to work together and these people working on separate individual projects so they can deliver at their own pace.

I think you can ask your manager to not pair you with this person in the next project as they can't work in a team. They would rather be more successful in an individual project. And you would be much more satisfied and happier working with someone who wants to work as a team on a project."

We see threads like this occasionally, and then today the mods are getting PMs about needing more intern salary surveys and complaining that BigN posts should be allowed all the time. These are two things that likely cause much of the anxiety among our readers. 

A small percentage of people here are going to work for the BigN and make 200K right out of school. Most people here will never make 200K a year. For every developer at Google, there are hundreds working at banks, insurance companies, mobile app firms, universities, nonprofits, and thousands of companies you've not yet heard of. 

Everyone isn't going to graduate from a top school, and there are plenty of devs with no degree at all, or a degree in music, or a bootcamp certificate, or an associates. 

I know thousands of developers, and the most successful didn't all get 4.0s and internships at BigN shops. The overwhelming majority didn't. 

And that's reality. If you're only getting your data from this sub, go read other stuff. Go to a local meetup and see where the crowd works. 

This sub can be toxic (you should see some of the stuff we delete). If it's causing you stress, by all means don't keep reading the threads about salaries and internships. Read about the people that made it despite not having the perfect pedigree.

Just a caveat: Look at my flair for context into some of the questions.  There are some (e.g. impl memcpy) that are 'lol easy' but I was expected to talk about the implementation to the hardware level and suggest optimisations to it that'd take advantage of the CPU arch capabilities.

Another point: Note that there are very few leetcode-esque questions.  For a sub that's obsessed with leetcode, I want to point out that there's a large segment in the industry that doesn't give 2 shits about algos and are more interested in domain-specific knowledge.

You don't have to be a Software Engineer,"Thanks for this post. As a fellow solutions engineer I spent way too much time thinking these type of roles were “less” than traditional SWE roles. 

But the truth is that I love helping people and that’s where I feel most valuable. Not so that some particular system can scale or is more efficient etc. 

At the heart of it, We should be solving “Human” problems first. And the solutions engineering role was where I found my love for this industry. 

This post is wholesome for me because I never had a traditional SWE Background and had a hard time adjusting to the real brainiacs of SWEs and their data structures and binary trees. 

Seeing someone from a traditional CS background write this post might not be popular as other posts on this sub, but this meant something to me. Thanks."
"Name and Shame: Epic Systems, for Unnecessarily Increasing Risk of COVID Transmission","I would also like to add that the CEO has included in an email to its employees, that if they don’t feel “comfortable” coming back to campus, they could request a leave of absence.

I collected around 1081+ jobs from companies that hire without whiteboard questions,"We do have a rule that prohibits promotional posts:

But there's good engagement from OP and I'm not seeing any sort of solicitation or services being offered here."
We should start a movement to push for 4 day work weeks.,"To be honest, there are companies where you can do this. These companies are usually fully remote, and they don't care how much you work per day as long as the work is done. I have a couple of friends in these sorts of companies, and one of them will pretty much just work Monday to Thursday, and maaaayyybbeee 1 or 2 hours on Friday if he still has some work to do.

So really, it's all about finding a company that:

1. Is remote 
2. Has management that doesn't micro-manage
3. Extremely flexible hours
4. Is not over-working their employees

Now, it's probably easier said than done to find such companies. But they are out there and you can join them and work 4 days per week!"

9-5 is killing my soul. How am I supposed to rationalize having my whole life essentially dedicated to work?,"I am in the same exact boat as you. 3 years in, I took some time off my corporate life to work for a farm with a highly flexible work schedule. I would probably be back into these thought patterns if I got a 9-5 again. That may be sooner rather than later... I do not feel like my lifestyle is sustainable.

Work sucks. Seriously. Between work+commute+dinner, you have time for like 1 or 2 things for yourself. Maybe working out. Maybe one other thing. Not enough time to relax, socialize, catch up on misc. chores/life stuff on the weekend, before bam it's monday again. Week after week. I couldn't enjoy my vacations because of the amount of work leading up to them, and the amount of work waiting for me upon my return. It was truly fucking pointless and stressful.

I really enjoy my life on the farm now. But frankly, I'm living off my savings. It won't be long term sustainable to keep up my car maintenance and try and enjoy the same social life I once did. I don't really have the income to go on all but the most inexpensive trips with my friends. Buying gear for outdoor recreation is a tough expense, etc. Won't have health insurance soon.

Work is an enabler. It is unfortunate, but that is reality. It is our privilege to have skilled, technical jobs that are in-demand all over the world, with the highest salaries and potentially the best work-life balance. Looking for less fulfillment inside of work, and focusing on finding ways work enables you to fulfill your goals outside of work will help.

All that being said, that is what I have researched and journaled. I'm still not working a 9-5. Still happy as fuck. I'll work 7 days a week some weeks, 4 days a week some weeks. Right now I pick what days I work and pick a great 1-2 days to go skiing.

You are like me. No one can make you appreciate work. Quit, go on some adventures, live on the rougher side of life. You will carve your own path doing something new and exciting. Or, you will return to the comfort and stability of 9-5, and truly appreciate it. Godspeed Brother."
Take stories in here with a grain of salt (with example),"On the flip side, there are tons of posts on here from people who apparently have no degree, no work experience, and just took a Udemy course and landed a six-figure salary after 8 months. OBVIOUSLY there’s more to that story too. 

They don’t have a CS degree, but they have a degree in math or something else tangentially related. 

They broke into web development, which is arguably easier to enter without lots of CS experience/knowledge. 

Although they hadn’t worked as a developer, they performed development-related tasks at previous jobs and leveraged that as relevant experience. 

Their first industry job didn’t pay 100k, it payed 45k. They worked hard and jumped companies a few times to get to that higher salary."
Verbal Offer Rescinded due to GPA,"Fuck man I'm sorry this happened to you. Unfortunately nothing is official until the written offer is accepted and signed. That's why it is best to not turn down other offers or renege or anything until all the paperwork has been done.

"Have you ever wondered what the hiring process was 20 years ago compared to today? Probably not, but I'll tell you anyway.","38 and the hiring ritual has definitely requires more preparation now.  It used to be that at top companies if you remember DS and algos from college and were relatively smart, you'd could get something equivalent to a leetcode medium.  Figure it out on the spot in 45min, and do pretty well.  

Now people are grinding out leetcode so frequently it is harder to distinguish yourself at the whiteboard just using your own abilities when your competition has turned leetcode problem solving into muscle memory."

Officially given up on trying to get a job as a software developer,"You're going after hard jobs, and don't have a lot of experience to back it up. Most robotics, ML, and compiler jobs are staffed by experienced engineers with masters degrees (something you could go get (look at OMSCS), but right now you need any job.  
If you really want to do ML, one option to just start working is to apply to small companies looking for data analysts and just work up from there. Just find a place that will let you get your foot in the door, and pay you to analyze data. You can use your ML skills (and develop more) while you are there.  
The second option is to go after backend engineering jobs: most of us are getting paid to write api endpoints for some server that talks to another server. Pick a language like Java, and learn a few of the libraries for writing web servers really well. If you do, a company will scoop you up based on your CS degree and those skills alone.  


Finally, it's okay to shift your focus onto easier/less prestigious jobs in the short-term, but keep your sights on Robotics/ML in the long term. Any job where you write code for a living with other people reviewing it will teach you a ton, and after a few years you can consider if you want to go back and get your masters, or work on a masters degree part time. After a few more years (and success at your jobs), you'll start to have access to positions your resume is focused on getting now."

Me: Oh, it's always like that. I haven't touched it since I created my profile.   


Person: Cool. Do you mind changing it?   


Me: Nah, I'm good."
Landing a job has nothing to do with technical skills,"Honestly this isn’t too far off. 

The only caveat is that there is a hard floor to the technical ability. Programming is still a part of it, and if you can’t do what’s expected, you won’t get anywhere applying to SWE positions. 

But once you meet basic competency for the job (which depends on the job) the focus quickly shifts to “can I stand to be in a room with this guy 8-10 hours a day” and “can I trust my customers to this person”."

Layoffs push down scores on Glassdoor: this is how companies respond,"Glassdoor has done this for years, it’s no secret. 

I once worked for a no name shitty startup that was getting pummeled on Glassdoor. The CEO didn’t even know what Glassdoor was and was floored.

"With the recent layoffs, it's become increasingly obvious that what team you're on is really important to your job security","Someone on my old team had great performance reviews, was part of 100 layoffs, and then literally rehired within a few months after being supplied with an internal recruiter. Does anyone know why they would willingly give him severance, encourage him to apply again, and then put him on a highly functioning team with a way higher salary? It just seems a bit backwards from a financial perspective. Why not just move him to another team?

A similar thing happened in 2008 (I know, spooky, right?) to someone on my current team. But during that time, they were hired back three years later, full wfh, higher salary."
"If an employer doesn't have a remote policy ""after"" COVID, I won't work for them","I agree, some companies suck with this.  I had a phone screening with a company yesterday for a position in another city (2-3 hours away).   I thought the screening went really well, the recruiter seemed pleased with my answers, the company did some stuff that I found really interesting and the type of development seemed a good fit for me.... Then he drops the bomb that it's fully in-person DURING COVID because WFH ""doesn't really work well for the company"" according to the recruiter.  

Sucks because it was an otherwise very interesting position, but having to find a place in a city 2-3 hours away and show up in person during COVID definitely dissuaded me from pursuing it."

Let’s all be a bit nicer to each other here,"I started using this sub around 2018 and its always been pretty toxic. I think it starts to become more obvious the more experienced you become and see the amount of bad advice here and the amount of people thinking that being a prick is cool. 

I've had people straight up throw personal attacks at me for stupid reasons. Being told that I was an asshole for sharing my opinion based on my own personal experience. That I wasn't a real SWE because I use NodeJS at my job(a student with no experience told me this). That I wasn't smart enough and should quit, etc. 

I used to be way more active here but over the years I've become less interested in commenting here. I would like to encourage people who may feel unsure about themselves or that come from a non-traditional background, but for every post I see that is positive I see one that's negative.

People feel the strong need to make themselves superior to others. I've said it before and I'll say it again: this industry has a serious asshole problem."

Name and Shame: Home Depot,"I live in Atlanta. I've interviewed with HD 3 times for 3 positions over the years. Literally each one has gone similar to this.

HD is a great company to work for (worked there ten years ago), but some of their processes are pure garbage and disrespectful of applicants time."
It's so much less stress when you're not pursuing major companies in big cities with 6 figure salaries.,"Congrats. I have always worked at companies like that. Places you might not have ever heard of, but still have a small software dept doing business software integrations and customizations. Finding people who fit in and work well together is the most important part in a small team."
Why does everyone in our field act like a dick?,"CS geeks in college are big fish in a small pond. It’s fairly easy to learn enough on your own that your first year or so of CS classes feel easy and contain a lot of ideas already familiar to you. To insecure people, feeling like the smartest person in the room is appealing. The poor communication this tends to foster makes the problem worse, as they assume everyone else is just too stupid to understand them. 

At some point they’ll encounter something actually challenging to them and learn some humility, hopefully. Whether that’s in more advanced classes or in the workplace, or in some other context. 

Of course some of them will just dig in their heels harder and continue to be insufferable. I’ve worked with these people. Nobody wants to work with them and they’re less effective at work because they can’t be bothered to actually understand the needs of users or other devs. But I think most people grow out of this behavior at some point. 

BTW a lot of open source communities are really friendly and welcoming; I’ve had good experiences at PyCon and other Python events. A lot of what you’re describing is just immaturity."
For the love of god please stop Peeing in the talent pool!,"Every time this comes up we say give them a contract quote for the time.

I vividly recall one guy that did, this year or last, and the company said ""sure"" without hesitation.  He made like $400 interviewing to work there, because he asked one question.

It's simple, you just say ""8 hours seems a little excessive to do for free, but I'm happy to do it at a billable rate of say $75/hr.  If that's okay with you I can start within a day.""

That's it.

If they still want the work but won't pay for it, that will tell you a whole lot about them.

Just remember to report the income as 1099 self-employment come tax time, and that it'll be taxed at 7% over what you expect.

I feel dumb for thinking this way,"Well, yeah... This makes sense. It's the foundational knowledge that's important. An HTTP endpoint is fundamentally an HTTP endpoint whether it's written in Java or Python. System design and architectural patterns are also generally language-agnostic and tougher to teach than a programming language."
The One Thing Wrong With Remote,"The first time I had a remote job, I was still in college, and Skype was the only game in town for video chat/soft-phone, and we were all running Linux, so there was only text chat. I didn't like that.

The company I'm in now had 1/3 of the company remote before the pandemic, and the approach to handling remote work is very different. We have a couple of hours a week where we all join Zoom, cameras off, and work at the same time, being able to say ""hey, anyone know..."" like we would over the cubicle wall. When we need to discuss any technical thing, we go directly to Zoom, and we often do that by posting the Zoom link in the team's Slack channel (not in DM), so anyone else on the team can eavesdrop if they want to learn what we're talking about. When technical discussions happen in text form, they're usually threads on the team's Slack channel, again, so other people can eavesdrop. 

So, I think it's possible (with intentionality) to create a collaborative learning environment in a remote work situation."

Why companies don't retain talent?,"We’ve lost 3 great engineers over the past 2 months, and I’m about to be the 4th. I talked with my manager pretty candidly about it and he said all of our recent departures have quit purely due to comp. I don’t blame ‘em. My raise last year was 5% with “Exceeds Expectations” performance rating. Right now I’ve got an offer on the table for a 55% increase from another company. It’s a sad state of affairs. I would’ve loved to stay at my company for a long time but loyalty isn’t paying the bills."
Is it okay if my Manager keeps asking about my personal life?,"Yeah, not OK.

One question - is there a history of bailing on things or calling out? Not saying it’s OK still (it is not at all), just trying to get context."

"Why Companies Reward Job Hopping, an Example","Exactly right. ""Switch jobs to increase income"" _is_ current folk wisdom, but not enough people actually ""walk the walk"" for it to be worth it for companies to change their strategy. 

Companies are definitely not dumb. At the cost of losing a few job-hoppers every year they are implementing a strategy that lets them retain the majority of cheap talent that:

* finds job interviews exhausting

* hates negotiating

* has good relationships with colleagues they don't want to lose

* has a comfortable commute or WFH arrangement they don't want to change

* is proud of becoming an expert / go-to-person in some part of the business and doesn't want to lose that source of social capital

* is proud of product or service they have made a big contribution to and wants to ""see it through to the end""

* is generally impresionable and does what management want without too much complaint

* (US only) cannot risk losing healthcare 

It's possible that in the future the ratio of *job-hoppers* to *lifers* changes and companies find they need to switch strategies. But until that happens the job-hoppers will have the upperhand compared to the lifers."

Anyone else feel like LeetCode encourages bad programming practices?,"I was laughing so hard when I read your post. You are absolutely right. At least for me, as a non-FAANG worker.

I have written software for ages now. And the main goal is *always* to write software that’s easy to read by humans and to not optimize prematurely. Indeed, the exact opposite of LeetCode.

As an anecdotal example I invite everyone to look at easy problem #1920. Impossible to solve without a solid understanding of the Euclidean algorithm. I did not know this one at all and as a result ‘wasted’ much time in this one. Hitting myself on the head that ‘I couldn’t even do an easy one’.

Now two observations:

- First: Were this an interview question I would fail. And fail hard. How am I to invent the correct algorithm? Out of thin air. On a whiteboard. With people judging me. In a short timespan. It’s never gonna happen. You either happen to know the solution and pass or you don’t and you fail.
- Second: This is so different from my day-to-day work that it’s actually fun. And I learned something. Not sure how and when this would ever be useful, but that goes for many things we stumble upon."

Take the stories on here about job searching with a grain of salt,"The job hunt can be easier or harder depending on the location, and we almost never get all the contributing factors for the harder ones in these posts. Plus by nature this sub is for advice, meaning that posters are more likely to be having a hard time. For these reasons and more, any potential entry level job-seekers should keep in mind that the posts on this sub are likely not reflective of the overall job market. Yes there is a degree of luck involved, but if a person who has a decent level of technical, interview and resume building skills, is consistent in putting out applications they won't be nearly as likely to go a year without *something* as this sub might make you think at times.

Also, the part that luck plays in the process isn't always a bad thing. Within one month of graduating my first bootcamp with no college degree I got into a really good internship that hired me on full time afterwards. All it takes is getting the right interview with the right person that you click with, you never know when that might happen. Before I came into the field, I was definitely prepared for a long lasting struggle to find a job (this probably had a lot to do with spending time on this sub). I honestly never even considered that I might get super lucky early on, which clearly is what happened."
Being a team player with a good attitude goes a lot further than being a brilliant jerk.,"I tend to agree but am biased because I have above average soft skills and am a junior.

Later I read an article about what makes a senior and it really stressed “creating business value” which means mentoring others, and can also extend to being a kind of rep for the clients (explain shit and sell the right solutions to non technical people for example). Since then I’ve decided that when I reach a senior level, one thing I’m gonna try not to bring is arrogance and a big ego."

I absolutely DESPISE the software dev culture,"I work every day in a team of 4 people: a lawyer turned software engineer, biochemist turned software engineer, a computer science major, and a circus performer turned software engineer (me). I can't imagine any other industries where there are so many different types of people working toward a similar goal, and there is virtually 0 drama amongst ourselves. I think that you are just temporarily around crappy people.


Edit: Since a few people were asking, here is my transition story.


Brace yourself, it might not be nearly as interesting as you think. Through my circus career, I just developed habits that enabled a smooth transition. In the circus, you will see death-defying stunts like a woman getting shot out of a cannon, or someone doing a triple backflip on a flying trapeze, or people dancing around on a few pieces of fabric hanging from the ceiling. While those are the big, impressive performances, none of them are as complicated as juggling. In any circus or circus school, you will always see the juggler practicing. Show up to the gym to start practicing at 8:00 in the morning? The juggler is already there. Show up an hour before showtime to put on your makeup and warm-up? The juggler is still there. Go to a bar afterward with the cast and crew? The juggler passes to put in more practice. Juggling may be one of the least impressive circus professions that you can have, while also requiring the most practice and dedication to do correctly. It was all about mastery because it absolutely sucks to drop on stage but dropping always happens no matter what you do.

I was a juggler.

Besides being a juggler, I dabbled in programming for a good while, making small programs, and building my own website. I had already planned to transition to software engineering. Through the years I slowly made my way through Harvard's CS50 course, the University of Helsinki's Java MOOC, and a handful of others. I did all of this with the same mindset that I had with juggling: mastery-based learning.

The simplest way that I can explain mastery-based learning is that whatever topic/subject/skill that you are learning, you should practice and study that topic/subject/skill until it's natural and also master the level that comes before it. What that means with juggling is that if you want to juggle 5 balls, master 4 balls in a 5-ball pattern. With JavaScript, that means if you want to declare and initialize variables, you should be able to fluently explain the differences between var, let, and const.

Now, I had a pretty nice career going on. I traveled the USA on a train with Ringling Brothers, performed on cruise ships going around Europe, performed in some Cirque du Soleil-produced shows and had started getting some pretty decent corporate work and festival offers. I hadn't planned on finishing my circus career for at least another 5-10 years.

And then Covid hit.

I had multiple contracts signed for the next two years, all disappear within a month. Performing venues across the world were forced to close. Las Vegas shut down, and there was no possibility of even street performing. My 10-year plan was modified to a 1-year plan: become a software engineer in order to survive.

I found and joined a mastery-based programming course which normally takes 1.5 years to finish, and completed that in four months. I then started building a handful of applications. The first one was an e-commerce data-management system, which I took as a solo project for a friend in exchange for some tendies, and then I found a few people (the lawyer and cs major) that were also on this job-transitioin path. Together we built an API tester (think slimmed-down Postman), a webhook tester, and a CLI tool for deploying ephemeral virtual waitrooms to the cloud.

With my experience and these projects, I've been able to comfortably take on side-gigs, and have just now started looking for much larger jobs, and am having a decent amount of success in terms of getting interviews. So far I've completed one code challenge, and have 4 phone calls scheduled for tomorrow.

In all, my transition was pretty smooth, and I owe it to having a mastery-based mindset, and kick in the ass."

I'm a software developer but I'm not a good one. How can I get better?,"Step 1: *breathe*. Imposter syndrome is real and everyone feels it. 

Step 2: try taking a practical approach to this. List out everything you are good at. Don’t think “I’m not good at X *because* someone else is better”. That’s wrong, and with that logic nobody is good at anything. (Example. I’m extremely efficient at finding answers on Google and other code)

Step 3: list out **everything** you want to know. Be as generic as you want. (Example. I want to learn more about AWS)

Step 4: revise list above by giving the real reasons you want to know it. Hint: “I want to be as good as/better than SonSo” is not a healthy reason. 

Step 5: for all the remaining topics with good reasons, start breaking them down into smaller tasks. (Example. AWS: research courses. Sign up. Allocate time each day to course work)

Here’s the reality: unless you go back to school for 4+ years for a CS degree, you won’t magically catch up in background to your peers. You already have the job, so focus on the skills you need for this job. If grinding leet code doesn’t apply to your work, don’t waste your time on it unless you’re genuinely interested."
Anyone else feel the constant urge to leave the field and become a plumber/electrician/brickie? Anyone done this?,"I used to be a teacher. Also worked in landscaping and restaurants.

My Experience with H1-B as a POC,"I've had the same experience, most companies, specially FANG do pay the same or more to their immigrants, but staffing companies just exploit them, in my previous job I know the vendor was paying 80/h and you would see the devs on visa making somewhere between 22-35/h  and the abuse is not only devs, I think the biggest abuse is in QA positions, in which the tasks most of the time won't require a lot of training but most of the time they get immigrants who are running out of options after finishing their masters and needing a job to stay, a good way to fix that is just to increase the prevailing wage and increase the penalties to the companies who abuse the system"
Growing within the same company is.....a joke,"I went from 55k => 100k on my first year on the job.

If this is so, your competences in CS could help you a lot in this respect. Know a domain well, know the people, the processes, the business side. Then identify something IT could simplify or make better: you have a true opportunity for disruption. On the contrary, I've seen tons of failed projects wherein data scientists or applied mathematicians thought they could apply a new technique to a domain area they had no clue about, and tackle the wrong problem while ignoring the obvious pitfalls of their solutions. Tons of good brains and money wasted.

Screen sharing gone wrong,"A recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app **permanently inaccessible** to users.

On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from [Apollo](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/) to [Reddit is Fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/13wxepd/rif_dev_here_reddits_api_changes_will_likely_kill/) to [Narwhal](https://www.reddit.com/r/getnarwhal/comments/13wv038/reddit_have_quoted_the_apollo_devs_a_ridiculous/jmdqtyt/) to [BaconReader](https://www.reddit.com/r/baconreader/comments/13wveb2/reddit_api_changes_and_baconreader/).

Even if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface .

Try asking in r/legaladvice more specifically, or a canadian equivalent if it exists.

Chances are it won't be worth much to fight. 

Try to stay with family/friends, maybe with that other intern who quit in solidarity with you, ask your former teammates for help, especially for referrals for other internship positions this summer.

I manage folks, and I know that at some point they'll all leave. My hope is that when they do it's for something they're really excited about, and that I've been able to help them get there. It's sort of like when I was a teacher and my students would graduate -- I would miss them, but also I was really excited for them to move on to the next phase of their lives. Not exactly the same, but sort of the same.

It's okay to feel sad. It's good that you feel sad, and I think you're feeling sad about the right things. And also it sounds like you're making the right choice for yourself, and I hope that you can also feel excited about that.

Just accepted my first job offer with no leetcode and what I've learned,"> In the end I accepted an offer for 72K with relocation assistance, profit sharing, **unlimited vacation**

Hey one piece of advice. Unlimited vacation ~~is~~ may also be code for less vacation.

Make sure to schedule 4+ weeks of vacation well ahead of time. Talk to your manager early and often.

I recommend scheduling, e.g. a long, very long vacation to somewhere you want to go, e.g. camping or to Europe or South America. Like 3+ weeks.

When the manager will say, ""well I need you to be back after 2 weeks."" You'll run into the fake part of ""unlimited"" vacation.

Then you'll say, but unlimited vacation, I'm going to take 3 weeks off.

They'll say well I can't let you vacation for the rest of the year.

Make sure you get the time off ahead of time, and then schedule your vacation before paying for anything.

If you're trying to learn a new programming language, stackoverflow and youtube videos may be very helpful. You can Google anything that you need on the job, or to prepare for technical interview questions. But most employers do want to see a Bachelor's degree in anything related to CS. I've even seen people with Business degrees switch into IT after taking a bootcamp online."
I interviewed with ~20 companies for a Senior Software Engineer position in Bangalore and Toronto - Here is a list of questions I was asked,"I documented the interview experiences in my blog ([https://www.soberkoder.com/interview/](https://www.soberkoder.com/interview/)), and this is a more extensive list of all the questions I was asked.

Hot take: Remote work is huge pain when you’re starting out and need to ask teammates stuff to get things resolved quickly,"My team is remote by necessity (we're all in different states) and folks would be raising hell if it took more than a couple hours to get a response on questions.  It really comes down to culture on the team.  It sounds like your team relies more heavily on in person communication, so remote kind of sucks.  Folks that rely heavily on remote work get a lot better at remote communication.  I'd raise the issue with your manager as a blocker for you so that they can push for a better SLA on remote help."
Sharing the System Design framework I’ve used that has served me well,"Good guide, quite comprehensive.

Would add these to the common topics to know:

consistent hashing, websockets/long polling/etc, Cassandra + KV DBs (why use this instead of relational), Key Generation Service, PostgresDB/SQL table designs, indexing, leader and follower via Zookeeper, config files via Chef... etc, SQS/SNS, Kafka, in-memory caching

Source: Received 5 200-300k TC offers this year with < 6 years of experience, 4 of them were liquid.

--

Edit: read some replies and wanted to add for reference, it's more important to learn the type of technology than the tech itself.

SQS/SNS are message queue + topic implementation in AWS, Cassandra and BigTable are wide-column DBs... so learn for example that message queues can be used for fault tolerance and wide-column DBs remove the need for association tables (don't quote me on this, I'm braindead from the holidays), Zookeeper can be used for majority etc.

"A senior engineer at work got upset with me and basically told me I was a ""diversity hire"" and I don't know what to do.","A few things:

-	Calling someone out as a “diversity hire” for their perception of your performance is a super asshole move and would probably get them fired where I work
-	Juniors right out of school make mistakes and need mentoring. What they did isn’t mentoring and as a manager myself I’d question wether they’re able to do the job of a senior engineer since it requires a lot of patience and perspective dealing with junior and intermediate developers 
-	You should speak to your manager about their expectations for you and if you’re meeting them. Mention the senior engineer and what they said. Be direct and transparent. 
-	Throw your misgivings about your status as a potential diversity hire right out the window. You were hired to do a job. Bust your ass and succeed at that job. If you’re something other than the mid twenties white dude engineer stereotype that doesn’t matter AT ALL when it comes to your capability."

> Like do I email? Slack? Set up a meeting? Does anyone have any advice for how to talk to him about this?

Door #3. Face to face is always best. Do not do this electronically, or your words have a far greater chance of being misinterpreted.

Ask questions about why he does what he does, and what he means by those things. Then tell him how those actions actually make you feel. Don't accuse him of intending to make you feel the way you do. He probably has quite good intentions. But we judge others not by their intent... but by how they make us feel. Try to see his side, and try to show him yours."

For people who are engineers that want to continue doing their thing I hope this encourages them to ask to be paid what their worth, or job hop like devs do to boost their salary. For people who switch, they seem to lead happier lives for it (sample size: my close friend group). And it's good for software developers because it furthers the field and attracts smart people who can build useful tools and help make software better.

1. try to keep some perspective in your life on a daily basis
2. purchase a bicycle and go on a mid day ride (*it doesn't have to be this exactly but you are not chained to your desk buddy* )
3. think about what kind of work scope/life would make you happy and figure out some good medium term goals that take you in that direction. 
4. work towards those goals, which may include job hunting or may include looking for opportunities to do different kinds of work with your current team or your current organization
5. don't let whatever specific goals you set blind you to interesting opportunities that pop up

Wow are Startups really like this,"As someone that has worked with and for startups, that sounds batshit insane to me, and I would skip that job post without even thinking twice.

As an engineer, startups are great because they afford you two things - freedom and constraints. When those two things are paired with solid management and engineering, you see creative solutions to problems flourish. 

If you're joining a startup to make money, then I've got bad news for you. Success is relative, and your idea of success is probably based on reading stories about unicorn companies where early-stage employees make a mint from stock. The chances of that happening at your startup are probably as likely as you winning big at a casino.

A lot of bosses will take advantage of people chasing the above dream, and they'll dangle the carrot of increased pay, excited investors, and quick progression through the ranks to work you to the bone. These bosses aren't the kind you want to work for. The ones you want to work for are those with a proven track record, and the desire to run a profitable company with a reasonable exit plan."

"How are the Russians always on top of all the programming contests (GoogIe Code Jam, Hacker Cup, TopCoder Open, etc.) but don't have any tech companies (almost all of the top tech companies are in the USA)?","Most capable Russian programmers flee to the US sooner or later. The reason is the corruption inside the Russian government, and inside their society in general. It’s Wild West in that part of the world. Yes, the US government is not ideal either, but they can’t hold the candle to what politicians do in Russia.

You can be Russian and build a successful startup, and then a local oligarch, with their mafia, shows up at your door, asking you “politely” to split some of your profits, or it can even be a proxy of the Russian state, disguised as some other entity. Look up what happened to Pavel Durov, the creator of vKontakte (a Facebook clone) and Telegram. IMO, vKontakte was miles better than whatever shit Facebook tried to spit out. But then a Russia media digital oligarch, who also happened to be Putin’s buddy, showed up at Pavel’s door, “asking” to sell vKontakte for peanuts. Pavel complied and soon fled to Dubai.

"Any other SWE’s amazed by software and technology, and wonder how average people don’t think it’s insane and so cool?","To some degree yes, but I do the exact same thing all the time.

Chemical engineering and material science has led to a bunch of amazing things. the electrical grid is outstanding in its capacity to function. The engineering effort to make rocket motors not melt is unbelievable. Modern cargo ships are a city unto themselves. Trains can criss-cross the continent on relatively few rails and basically never collide thanks to an intricate signaling system.

That's just engineering-focused stuff. The whole of modern society is a terribly complex emergent system formed by the interplay of many terribly complex subsystems all working together, many of which are not engineering but are nonetheless complex and interesting. Law, psychology, the paradigms we base our whole thinking on. All of these and more can easily be the subject of a lifetime of study.

Got an internship in the midst of all this chaos!,"> I have a 2.8 gpa, minimal leetcode practice, and no prior CS internships. I didn't have some crazy personal projects, just 2 school group projects listed on my resume.

honestly thanks for posting, these are the kinds of things i need to see to not get down on myself"
"To all those who are struggling with computer programming or doubting their abilities, or to those considering a mid-life career change. I’d like to share a bit of my story.","This also applies to CS as a freshman/sophomore. If you're struggling in an intro class, some people love to say ""if you cant handle these early classes you should switch majors"" when usually your professor/course is really poorly taught and the people who are doing well already know the material or learn it from Youtube. Once you have a structured course with a professor who is smart and works hard, it makes even the most difficult material much more approachable."
Normal to feel like a 'breakup' after leaving a company?,"Yeah, I think that's normal.

I think it would be abnormal to not miss the people you created relationships with and saw on a near-daily basis.

Just like real relationships though... **you broke up because you were not getting what you needed**. So you moved on, moved in with the rebound.. just because the new job isn't a great match, doesn't mean that you old job is ""the one.""

Also how long were you at the old company vs. the new one? If you were at company A for 2 years, and now you're at company B for 2 months.. of course you won't have the level of rapport that you had before - maybe give it time.

If you're genuinely unhappy with where you are, then look for the next spot - no need to romanticize the past.

**EDIT:** WOW! Thanks for the award and all the upvotes!"

"I was on unemployment benefits last year. Taught myself how to code, got a job six months ago, and was just offered a 30% raise, thus giving me my first 6 figure salary! Here's my story!","Well done on the raise! Your success certainly encourages me, a fellow self-teaching programmer, that I can in fact get a job and the grind is worth it. Happy coding, my guy."
Finally did it,congrats! refreshing to see a new graduate on this sub getting an offer in more low-level stuff. it's encouraging to hear dedication to more niche interests eventually pays off.
It's so cool that educating yourself even further is a part of the job.,"My previous boss: 
“Our programmers are hired with the assumption you already know everything you need for the job. Don’t learn new things on the job.”

Also my previous boss:
“We can’t move forward with updating outdated products (XHTML, XML, Flash, no back-end at all) because we can’t hire good programmers who want to learn new things.” 

Also my previous boss:
“Use JavaScript so nobody has to learn anything else - and please no jQuery - only JS. The other programmers only know JS. Yes, for the back-end. No, not Node - we can’t use open source. Build it in ASP.NET, but with JS.” 

... Having supervisors who understand and support the reality of this field is quite beneficial."
Does anyone else think we are in the greatest career ever?,"I love how software engineers are needed in every field, from medicine to manufacturing to banking. The list goes on and on. There are always interesting problems to solve, so if one thing bores you, you can always find some other cool thing to work on. There are some downsides depending on the job, but overall it's a great career path."
Why don't companies care more who they lay off?,"> star engineers with internal awards and 15+ years tenure.

These people probably get paid more than the uncut people."
Daily standups are just attendance meetings,"In that case, you've misunderstood what the purpose of a standup is.

It is to give a status to the team about work done (or work that is more complicated than expected) so that the team can adjust their work to meet the sprint goal.

It is to give a plan for what people plan to spend their time on before the next standup.

It is so that the developers can tell whether or not they're blocked by something.

A standup is basically a quick ~~status~~ planning meeting that everyone attends, and if anyone has hit any snags that can be dealt with after the standup (this usually doesn't need to involve everyone)."
How I went from $14hr to 70k with no experience,"Where did you start learning everything, and how much did it cost you in total? I've been trying to get into the Tech business for a while. I've always loved computers and have been really good with them but I don't know where to start. Every time I look into it, I realize it's gonna cost me an arm and a leg. I don't make that much, and I have bills. Thanks ahead of time."
Protip: NEVER let your client work on your project,"I can very very much agree. I recently was tasked to make my first website for a small business, they wanted me to put stock photos and lorem ipsums and then wanted to change out the content themselves, told me that when they were done I should put the website online. Turns out they had no fucking clue what to do, broke contract several times (including the deadline by several weeks), expected me to support them for free, were quite rude in general and it was a huuuuge hassle ""finishing"" the project for what little money I took anyway since it was my first job. Two things I learned there were to never let clients underpay you and, as you said, never let them work on your project. I also only got 250 bucks lol, but the value of what I learned in that time far surpasses that."
I got a big (40%) raise,Congrats man to the balls you got and to the Boss that Sees and recognizes your value.
anybody else grinding leetcode in their late 20s trying to switch jobs?,"Like every other person I know.

As for strategy... Depending on your target companies you could just try to prep for easy to medium level of leetcode and forget about the hards. Should work at a lot of places other than the hardest like FB/hft shops etc. Even at the hard places it comes down to luck and plenty of people just get mediums. For mediums you can start off with a good list like Blind 75 or Sean Prashad which has hards also. 

Also, don't forget to prep for System Design and a little time for preparing you past project/behavioral. 

Good luck!"
What even is this job market,"Lots of crazy churn at the moment because of the pandemic.  90% of my previous team left, including me; and I just joined a team that's been reorged due to departures.  My roommate at Amazon said half his team had left and he's planning on jumping ship.

You're amazing and you need to hear it more often.,"This resonates with me a lot. A year ago, I landed my absolute dream job at a big company that are the best regarded in their field, for good pay. I was on a high for months, but eventually, the magic always wears off and it becomes ""just another job"". I daydream sometimes about a new job in a new field, but I know that too would lose its lustre once I got there. At the end of the day, wherever I am, I'll spend 9 hours a day looking at a terminal, sublime text, Excel and PowerPoint, and the bigger picture of what cool project you're working on gets lost in a sea of error messages and stack exchange tabs.

Find your peace and your identity outside of work. Don't work 12 hour days for a corporation that won't remember you. Enjoy your free time and force yourself away from your monitor, especially during lockdown."

Name and Shame - Tata Consultancy Services,"The bodyshops like Tata have a very simple business model;  
  
* Go into F500 non tech firms where management is often more MBA background than tech.  
* Promise to undercut competitors per body, selling to someone who thinks number of bodies is more important than work output.  
* Once in, take care of client manager who owns vendor relationships.   I have seen free golf trips to pebble beach, whatever the manager's passion is, they are about to get a lot of it free.  
* Find in India young people who couldn't find any possible better job.   Sign them to horrible contracts they can't easily get out of.  Promise they will eventually be sent to America.  
* Flood the H1B lottery process with all of these offshore workers.   Land a number of them H1B's.   
* Send H1B's to client sites in America.   Severely underpay by US standards.   
* Since the H1B's they sent are fairly weak in experience, education, and skills, the vast majority can't find other employers to port their visas to.  
* It takes decades now for Indians to go from H1B to greencard, so these firms sponsor greencard knowing they get to keep their employees virtually for life at extremely low wages.  
* Those in IT departments in these F500 firms get frustrated working with substandard bodyshops, so leave for better run firms, causing huge IT problems within the firms.  
* With the higher quality employees leaving, management feels stuck, as the bodyshop employees start appearing to be keeping on the lights, as badly as they are doing.   
* Very high cost boutique consulting firms step into the void to get work completed, while the bodyshops do the lowest level tech work.   The boutiques will often be charging $500k a year per person to replace each of those old longer serving IT staff members who left the firm (who were often of salaries closer to $100k-$150k).   
* Eventually, even management starts moving on from the firm (as budgets have blown out, IT quality has plummeted).   Since so many bodyshop H1Bs are Indian, often Indian management is then hired to take over, making it much easier for the bodyshops to work with decision makers.   Now there are relatives who can be hired offshore, and a myriad of ways to ensure the manager would never move on from the bodyshop.  
* The bodyshops are entrenched in the firm for life, continuing every year to bring in more of the H1B's.    
* The bodyshop makes a fortune.   
* The boutique firms make a fortune.    
* The smart old employees join the boutiques and are earning far more.  
* The business side is left wondering why their IT department quality is so terrible, without understanding the lifecycle above."
Manager gave me “did not meet expectations” on year end review. what to do?,"Go on the plan, but the truth of the matter is you're working for a shitty manager. NOBODY should ever be blindsided by a negative annual review. She's been essentially lying to you for the entire year in your 1-on-1's. If you have no choice but to keep reporting to this person, I'd start looking for another job. And when you do, have fun in the exit interview explaining what a shitty manager she is."
"My coworker ""refactored"" all of my code while I was in sick-leave","A recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app **permanently inaccessible** to users.

On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from [Apollo](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/) to [Reddit is Fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/13wxepd/rif_dev_here_reddits_api_changes_will_likely_kill/) to [Narwhal](https://www.reddit.com/r/getnarwhal/comments/13wv038/reddit_have_quoted_the_apollo_devs_a_ridiculous/jmdqtyt/) to [BaconReader](https://www.reddit.com/r/baconreader/comments/13wveb2/reddit_api_changes_and_baconreader/).

2 YEAR UPDATE: My journey & tips: 2.9 GPA at a small liberal arts college w 1 mediocre internship –> 4 FTE offers incl FB,"> I came into FB with definite imposter syndrom

I recently got accepted a job from Amazon and I already have imposter syndrome. I am in the same position that you once were - bad gpa from a not so great college, 1 internship where I did next to nothing.

I have about 2 months before I join. What are the absolute basics that someone who knows nothing needs to know to be successful at a big company? This is what I am currently doing: I have taken online courses for git, red hat linux and unit testing in java. I am currently reading clean code everyday before sleeping and once I am done with that I plan to read head first design patterns.

Devs were quitting in droves then, but the execs absolutely refused to consider continuing to allow remote work.

Leaving Amazon :: A Blog Post from an Angry/Disappointed VP & Distinguished Engineer,"I joined Amazon 11 months ago. It's an amazing place to learn and grow as a new grad engineer, but also incredibly stressful. The mandatory annual attrition target and stack ranking ensure that your life literally becomes a race against your co-workers. Nobody knows who's going to be put on a PIP next. I know an SDE2 who has been here for 4 years and lost one of his family members and is now being managed out just 1 month later because of performance issues. Any kind of empathy is severely lacking here.

What are the top 10 software engineer things they don't teach you in school?,"Reading existing code, understanding existing code, making changes to existing code, etc. And writing code that would be easier for others to change.

Almost all the code you write as a CS student involves writing programs from scratch or writing a library or a function or an algorithm from scratch. That is the easiest to learn and to grade.

Almost all the tasks you would do when you work in the industry especially as a junior involve making changes to existing code without breaking anything and when you get to write new code, it needs to be code that others are less likely to break."
"Pet peeve: ""this take-home project should take 2 hours max.""","I had this exact discussion with a dev manager of a company I was contracted out to. They already had decided to contract me (they needed a lead engineer/software architect) but they didn't want bad optics so they asked me to do the same coding assignment everyone else did. 

The assignment was a fairly trivial application with a Spring Boot REST back-end and a SPA front-end. But like you said; doing this *properly* (with proper unit and integration tests) would take me at least a day.

I discussed this with the dev manager and said that I'd be happy to write part of the Spring back-end (I'm not a front-end dev) but that I would spend a max of 2 hours on it, and that was fine. However; he really believed that it would take you 2 hours or so because that's what he asked the developer who designed it to do: ""create an assignment that should take about 2 hours tops"". The developer came up with that crap, no one called him out on it because ""not my problem"" and the dev manager simply believed it. 

I asked around who actually did the assignment and asked them in private how long they really took. No one who did the test managed to do it in 2 hours. But none of them actually *said* anything because they were afraid it would make them look bad. 

So this is really the shitty situation we're in. People really assume too much when they think companies do this to steel work. The situation is much simpler, it's simply an example of Hanlon's razor: ""never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity"".

*That said*; I know quite a few cases where people completely stuck on coding assignments simply because they could not hack it. While I assume that's not the case in your example, companies need *some* form of technical testing and a lot of applicants do prefer take-home tests over having to do whiteboarding for example. So this is not a simple problem to fix."

I get a response a real quick from the recruiter when i mention I’ll be explaining the ghosting to the ceo.  Sometimes  I mention :

*  how the experience affects their business
*  how it influences future recruiting efforts (tell all my friends not to interview with them)
*  remind the ceo how much the recruiters are being paid ($100k+) to play match the keywords but still manage not be held at the same standard as a sales or account managers who answers all of their emails.
  *  how the ghosting contradicts with the company values on the career page which usually say something about empathy, going above and beyond, attention to detail, etc.."
Feeling less than motivated after discovering my male counterparts make more than I do.,"> Is it time to start looking elsewhere?

It's always time to be looking elsewhere. Looking doesn't mean you're obligated to leave, but you should be looking so that you're aware of your market value and other opportunities. 

But yes, especially in this situation you should be looking for a new opportunity. Your current company clearly has no intention of compensating you fairly or taking your concerns seriously, so find somewhere that will."

Like, sometimes, boom, you solved this difficult problem with a clever solution that just works. Other times, you don't remember some basic things about your tech stack or don't know the inner workings that  well but then you meet others in your industry  that know it inside out like the back of their own hand and you just question your life?"
A lot of toxic traits surfaced in me when applying to jobs. Here’s how to avoid my mistakes.,"It gets said so many times including by OP. But it's not said enough.

GET OFF SOCIAL MEDIA.

Hell even reddit can be too much if you spend it arguing with people. I had to take a break from Reddit because I am very into politics and the whole political culture has gone crazy. 

It's just not good for your head to either be comparing yourself to others on facebook or arguing with complete strangers every day.

I wound up handing my social media accounts to my wife and asked her to change my password. Because otherwise I would have just gotten back on no matter what I did myself. It's an addiction."
"Why is the advice of ""do side projects"" so common when most employers don't even look at them?","If you have 0 professional/intern work experience, then having a couple projects is a useful discussion point. It's hard to hold a conversation for 30-60mins if the only thing you have on your resume is school and a part time job in a different field.

I have a couple years of experience now and don't put any side projects on my resume. Almost no one asks for them either."
I've reviewed thousands of applications for university recruiting at a startup. Here are some numbers and thoughts on the university recruiting process.,"Just to toss a question out there...

> We have multiple locations across the US and the ones outside of the SF Bay Area were always harder to fill. If you're struggling to find a job in the Bay Area it might be helpful to also apply to other places.

What is the ratio of applications for positions in the Bay Area compared to elsewhere?"
My Thoughts On Leetcode,Solving a 4x4 Rubiks cube while you explain every single move and the reasoning behind it and at the same time multiple people are staring at you watching everything you do.  And you know one move could completely affect the next few years of your life.

Is working from home the new norm for CS professionals?,"My company's CEO has said that they expect up to 60% of the company to WFH ""long term"""
"I don't want to be a rockstar coder. When 5PM hits, I want to go home, and not think of a single line of code. Is that too much to ask for?","First off: do not listen to someone that says overtime is expected everywhere in this industry.  It's not.  Plain and simple.  Quality work is expected, regardless of the time you spend on a task.  You don't have to work forever to be a rockstar coder, or even a decent coder.  A lot of your work schedule has to do with you, and the limits you set with your managers.  And yes, you will find bad managers that push your limits, but you will find that in any industry.  It's not unique to software.

For a bit of background experience, I'm about as far along as you in my career.  My first job sounds like what you describe.  Force 60 hour weeks.  Constant demand for overtime.  And even then, managers called us all into meetings and yelled at or lectured us for not working enough, and demanding more overtime.  All the while, projecting the same work load for the next year.  I left that job as soon as I could, once they made that announcement.  And I made sure that, in my job search, I was very clear that I do not and will not work overtime (you know, unless I broke something.  I'll clean up my own mess).  My current job, I work 40-45 hour weeks as my normal.  Heck, some weeks I have 35 hours.  This is because I set limits with my managers very early on.  Send me an email after hours?  Best you're gonna get from me is, ""I'll do that first thing in the morning.""  Now, that did increase my workload.  But, I adjusted my workday.  Several people I know and work with complain about overtime and never getting work done, but they sit and watch netflix or browse reddit for 3 hours out of the day.  I'm not saying you do that, because I have no earthly idea.  But, if you go in and work hard, glued to your IDE or console for 8 hours, you'll be surprised at the work you get done.  Doing this, my managers have compared me to, and given me the work of senior engineers.  And I still don't work overtime.

It's not impossible, and don't let anyone tell you that you have to work overtime regularly to make it in this field.

tl;dr: set your own limits starting at the interview process.  You'll have shitty managers in any industry, so don't let that deter you from software."
You can do it.,I gave up and went into healthcare lol. It just wasn't for me. I have nothing but respect for ya'll who pull through though.
"to those making bank (say, > 200k/year), how different is your job compared to mine?","Every company is different, salary is not correlated with the shit you have to eat at work.

Sometimes you can get silly money and end up in a chill decent place. Other times you get pennies and the place is a shithole.
That is life for you."
"The number of increasing people going into CS programs are ridiculous. I fear that in the future, the industry will become way too saturated. Give your opinions.",The number of people coming out of those programs is a fraction of those going in. You’re good.
how 6 figures salary is perceived by US citizens?,"I don't want to speak for everyone else, but my US salary allows me to buy whatever I want (at least reasonable everyday things - not things like yachts obviously) without having to think about the cost, eat out as often as I want, etc.

Despite that kind of economic freedom, it's still difficult to afford a nice house, so there's that.

Also, I know that my job can be gone in any moment, and I'm also a hospital bill away from going broke."
Why does standup feel like an interrogation?,"Standup meeting should be quick.   If you're running for 30-50 minutes, that's not a standup meeting, it _IS_ an interrogation.

The purpose of that meeting has nothing to do with justifying your work or any lateness.  It is supposed to be where members of the team make each other aware of what they're working on, so they can coordinate anything that might step on each other's toes;  and to let the team know if they have anything blocking their progress so they can get help if needed.

In my experience, hour-long status meetings are the duct tape on the broken window -- it doesn't fix the window, and actually makes it harder to use, but covers up the thing that is broken -- and they usually indicate a project that is very ""waterfall,"" with budget and delivery date bother overrun, and some project manager has been thrust in place to try to get it under control.  

Calculate the number of people in the standup meeting, and multiply that by what you think is the average salary.  Then extend that hourly rate over the course of a week, month, and year, and start causally mentioning those numbers in your standup meetings.  Let it start to permeate the ether just how much of the company's money is being wasted, not to mention stealing 15% of your workday every day and making you fall behind."

Why won’t you let me get my tubes tied?,After adequate counseling (sometimes I make super young people do a short waiting period - like 2 months) I’ll tie anyone’s tubes.
I have a question,Omg thank you for that edit I was shook to my core
Need help - Harvard gave up - homeless,"Does eating make the pain any worse/better? Are you avoiding eating because it worsens your symptoms or have you lost appetite entirely? Do you have any difficulty swallowing?

Does anything in particular (movement, etc.) make the pain worse? Do over the counter analgaesics (paracetamol, NSAIDs, etc.) help at all?

Given when/how it came on, I would be most concerned about mechanical trauma to the diaphragm, esophagus or LES. Displacement of the liver is unlikely given how firmly anchored it is.

Just to clarify, did you have all of this battery of testing **after** the chiropractor? I would also consider esophageal manometry assuming you haven't had it already.

Were esophageal biopsies taken during the EGD? I would also be quite suspicious of eosinophilic esophagitis given your description."

Wife 31F has weeks to live amidst coronavirus,"I'm an oncologist. I'm so sorry for your situation. I've been asking my end stage patients to go with their hearts in these cases.

My heart breaks for you and your wife.

Edit: I'm sorry. I wrote that response as I was going to sleep and oversimplified in a hurry. What I meant to communicate is that she will be the most likely to potentially suffer if one of the individuals who visits her is infected by COVID19 (assuming no elderly or immunocompromised individuals visit her while an infected person is present). 

I would also recommend utilizing face time and other videoconferencing approaches to the extent possible. It's not the same, but it's something. I have a feeling you are probably already doing this though, you seem like a super thoughtful person."

AskDocs is great but is NOT a substitute for a real doctor - A cautionary real tale.,"100%. I give this advice in every response, even if I’m relatively sure that the person just has a simple condition like a UTI or late-onset allergies. 

There’s just no way for us to have all of the information. Similarly, there are many things that patients themselves may not take into account. I just gave advice a day or so ago on a case of shortness of breath. This guy could live at sea level, but is currently visiting Denver for all I know. Or he could have been gearing up to a heart attack. There’s so many variables at play, and without a detailed medical history and the ability to perform testing, there’s only room for best guesses. 

ALWAYS SEE A DOCTOR! 
Unless you’re already dead, then you can take my advice as law. 😁

I hope that your condition improves, OP. Best of luck."

Mg citrate is what we often use for colonoscopy cleanouts for teenagers and young adults.  It's pretty effective.  It's not a wonderful experience or anything, but you'll feel so much better with a squeaky clean colon.  

It's a potent osmotic laxative, so you may have some cramping, which is normal.  It often takes a few hours to have a full effect.  Sometimes, but not usually, there is so much poop you need second cleanout.  If that's the case, you're better off using a bunch of Miralax."

"Female, 31, healthy BMI living in Madrid Spain.... I’ve got COVID-19. They said to take paracetamol, and quarantine....but the healthcare is so collapsed they are not even taking calls anymore. Any tips? Does paracetamol help?","Paracetamol can help with symptoms like fever, sore throat, and body aches. Salbutamol can help with bad bronchitis so if your having a hard time breathing it would be a good idea to try that. I'd really recommend you try and find a way to keep yourself and the dog indoors but if you must walk your dog make sure both you and the dog aren't touching things or coming in contact with others."

My daughter 16F suddenly loses ability to speak and writes in strange ways - attention seeking or autism/neurological disorder??,"OP's question was answered excellently by u/Mental-Swordfish-432. Their advice as a physician was *superb*, and I stand by everything they said. Other verified users also added good points. 

Since OP was given great advice/further advice, this thread is being locked. Understanding what OP and her daughter may be going through is important, so we must respect their space. While I'm happy to see everyone eager to give their opinion, this thread has gotten out of hand. 

Social media sites like Tik Tok are fun, but they may negatively affect population health. While some Tik Tok videos may give good resources, not all videos are vetted by medical doctors or psychologists. Remember, anyone can post any content on social media without getting fact-checked. Keep this in mind.

Suppose you or a loved one believes you suffer from a specific mental illness or disease after viewing a video on social media. In that case, it's best to visit a real physician or psychologist to address your concerns specifically rather than use Tik Tok to self-diagnose. 

Every disease or illness sometimes comes with many *differential* diagnoses, so if an illness resonates with a particular group of people on social media with a specific diagnosis, it's important to get it checked by a professional. Getting the diagnosis correct will affect treatment outcomes. This *requires* professional intervention. 

Unfortunately, social media is overused and abused, and we can all see many negative effects imposed on medicine and correctly diagnosing. Please understand the drawbacks that apps like Tik Toks have on the population, especially the youth. If you don't know, social media apps like Tik Tok use algorithms to tailor specific videos. This results in individuals being exposed to the same type of content for hours on end. 

Please stay safe and be responsible when using social media."

UPDATE: [26F] recommended for termination of pregnancy in a country where I don't speak the language,"I'm glad you got the answers you needed. 

Regarding the inpatient termination if you are wanting clarification I think it would be which route are you going:

1) will you receive osmotic and/or chemical dilators and then go on to have an evacuation procedure?

2) will you receive osmotic and/or chemical dilators and then go on to have an induced delivery? Just an fyi with this, people not infrequently require manual removal of the placenta, so they end up having the 'evacuation' portion anyhow (but it would just be the placenta).

Both are safe. Some ""feel better"" about the second option because they feel like they are just inducing labor rather than actually ""terminating"". Fetuses in general, but especially a compromised one, have high rates of passing before delivery anyhow though.

Also, you could choose to have genetic testing of any remains (and not do CVS or amniocentesis). But it is one of those things where it's optional and it may not truly change anything for you. This being said, many people like having a more solid answer.

Good luck with everything. You have very good odds of having normal babies in the future."

My cousin (24M) was having surgery to remove a lung due to cancer and now the doctors are saying he’s brain dead. Is there any hope for his recovery??,"There have been a number of helpful and less helpful comments. Additionally a lot of comments ‘for visibility’,  which are not allowed in this subreddit.

Regarding the tragic events during your cousins surgery: there will be a incident analysis to see what went wrong. The surgeon and anaesthesiologist should keep your family updated on this process. Your family can consult a medical malpractice lawyer, if you wish. Legal questions are outside of the scope of this subreddit.

Regarding the neurological state: brain death is a quite narrow and strictly defined condition. It is irreversible. All brain functions, including automatic functions like breathing, are lost. Brain death is diagnosed with a clinical exam, usually by a neurologist. Often other tests, like EEG, CTA or TCD are used/needed.

Given the fact that he breathes on his own, he cannot be brain dead. 

A lot of ICU patients with brain damage exhibit movement that could be interpreted as voluntary, but aren’t. A neurologist should be able to explain how they interpret his movements.

There are a lot of states in which a large amount of brain damage has occurred without complete brain death. There is a whole spectrum from a persistent vegetative state to minimal conscious state. There is no way to reverse brain damage, but patients can become more responsive to their surroundings, a small number of patients are able to regain meaningful communication. It is not easy to predict if, when and how much improvement occurs. For some people (myself as a neurologist included) such a state is not worth living.  His family needs try and tell the doctors what your cousin would choose if he could speak and what his wishes would be."
My neighbor (36M) dropped dead in front of me. I failed to resuscitate him. Hoping to get better understanding of his cause of death.,"Just chiming in to reinforce what has been said. We can't tell you exactly what happened, because we can't know without a lot more information. However, we can say a few things. 

Seeing someone die is always a hard thing to deal with. The first death we all saw in our careers stay with us, even when doing CPR becomes a routine thing, and if you ask the majority of us we'll be able to tell you what happened in detail, even after quite a few years. It does get easier though, once you realise that the person you were trying to resuscitate needed resuscitation in the first place; they were dying without your intervention and you did all you could to try and change the outcome from what was already going on. In your specific case, the fact that you kept pumping his blood for him well enough for paramedics to get a return to circulation means you did a good job of it. 

You should consider talking to a counselor about this. It is definitely a big thing to process, and it's normal to struggle with it. We usually get a debrief from our seniors after a death, and getting to talk it over with someone who can help you unpack it all is quite helpful.

Also, know that there are various different kinds of syncope, and the kind you have doesn't cause an increase in your risk of sudden death."

"I found out that I was born with 4 kidneys last month, all fully formed. After some extra testing, I was told yesterday that 3 function properly too. Thinking of donating one of them?","I would just say enter into this very, very carefully.  It's amazing of you to want to donate.  But keep in mind that living donors for liver and kidney transplant is not a low risk venture to begin with.  As /u/PokeTheVeil suggests, no one can give you good advice without pretty detailed understanding of your anatomy and medical risks.  I'll just say that, in general, donating an organ when you have abnormal anatomy increases the risk to the donor, so getting an opinion from a high volume center with a surgeon who has done this exact operation in someone just like you is essential."

"If I tested positive for Coronavirus and have already recovered, can I still carry the virus and infect other people? 24 Y/O male asking about possibly infecting my 62 YO male father who has had previous heart surgeries","If you had tested positive for COVID-19 two weeks ago, it is indeed possible that you are still positive, even if you have recovered clinically. Some patients continue to shed virus for longer periods of time (I think the maximum has been upto 49 days). However, most people will not be shedding active virus in 4 weeks after being positive (3 weeks should be enough, I am being conservative). The immunity from the infection is probably quite long-lasting (at least until this pandemic is over), so you don't need to worry until a mutated strain starts circulating in a few years. One can get external clothing contaminated by secretions from people with active infection, so you can theoretically transport virus on your clothes, but I think that probability is low, unless you are a health care provider in a COVID-19 unit. Regardless, I would suggest you shower and change clothes before meeting your dad, which you can do in a couple of weeks."

"My Mother Was Anti-Doctor, How Do I Find A Doctor That Will Help Me With Missed Vaccines, Undiagnosed issues, missed exams, etc.","I was also medically neglected. I didn't establish a real relationship with a primary care physician until I was 37. Until that point I'd just used urgent care facilities when I had an issue. Unfortunately, that's a suboptimal way to treat my asthma. Additionally, like you, I had a severe (shoulder rather than elbow) injury at 16 that went completely untreated. 

My PCP is awesome! He's been my doc for nearly 8 years now and we have an actual relationship. He trusts me, I trust him. He knows about the lack of medical care I received in my childhood, and he's super patient with me when I ask dumb questions. 

I recommend finding a PCP in your area who is part of your insurance network. Your first visit is longer than normal because the MD needs time to collect a through history. Just be honest, and thorough. It's important to let him/her know that you were medically neglected because it's going to affect how they treat you. (Medically treat you, not treat you as a person.)

Finding a good PCP can be life changing. Keep looking until you find one."

I'm 33 and I have just learned that I have 45 chromosomes. What now?,"To be honest you really do need the actual details of the genetic test (which chromosome is missing?) and to see a genetic counselor. 

Given that you're a guy, it's actually really interesting (sorry, I know you don't want to be interesting). I'm wondering if you're a super super rare Male Turner syndrome or perhaps a mosaic/chimera - which means basically your body is made up of two sets of genetic material. (Edit: or as others have mentioned a Robertsonian translocation where effectively the genetic material is all there but the number of chromosomes is less due to swapping of chromosome “arms”)

Please give me/us an update! If they are willing to give you any information right now, I'd at least ask 'can you tell me which chromosome is missing?' That would give us the most to go on right now.

If it’s anything other than 45 x then I would assume it’s almost certainly a robertsonian translocation

Edit: also OP if you read this again, what sample did you give for karyotype (blood, semen, etc)?"

Anti-vaccine dad wants to sue me for getting our child vaccinated.,"I'm locking this thread, the right answer has already been given. We do not tolerate medical misinformation on this sub."
"My very smart Dad has recently started reading and believing all these ridiculous conspiracy theories regarding 5G, Coronavirus, and even one about Trump having a time machine. He’s a history teacher and extremely clever, and never believed things like this before seriously.","I'd certainly like to believe that belief in conspiracy theories is consistently associated with specific psychiatric disorders, but the truth is that it's so widespread that (at least when it's not excessive) it may even be considered ""normal.""  The Internet has certainly made that worse.  Thanks so much, Reddit.  

From my own experience, we deal with conspiracy theories related to vaccines in pediatrics quite frequently.  One thing to remember is that approaching him with more facts is unlikely to change his mind.  [Studies have shown](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1981-05421-001) that doing so can entrench believers even more into their conspiracy, and is probably counterproductive.  Usually the best approach is to use emotional appeals, as manipulative as they may seem.  Things like ""I'm worried about you getting COVID, Dad!""  or ""I don't want you to die from the flu, Dad.""

That being said, declines in cognitive function (which have many causes at his age) and worsening anxiety also tend to heighten belief in verifiably false facts."

Vomited what looks like coffee grounds. Emergency?,You need to go to the ER. Any signs of GI bleeding like you describe is an emergency.
"Mom (58F) died of a aneurysm rupture in front of me yesterday, I have questions","I'm very sorry for your loss.
From the way you describe it she probably lost consciousness the moment she was on the bed and no more responsive. She was comatose because of the bleeding. Breathing still works because that is regulated from the brainstem, which is deep down in the brain. 
The paramedics probably presumed a intracranial bleeding because of the events. Headache and suddenly coma is very typical. 
The device the doctor put into her throat could be a laryngoscope, a device used to introduce a breathing tube into patients. 
The vomiting is caused by the pressure build up in the head."

"How come testosterone therapy is acceptable for transgender people wanting to present more masculine, but not for cisgender males who may wish they be more masculine?","Those who were born female produce minimal endogenous testosterone and so therefore need to supplement with exogenous testosterone in order to transition. Those born male already produce endogenous testosterone. If you are clinically hypotesterone, then you can get it prescribed. However there are significant side effects and drawbacks to giving a person with normal testosterone levels extra testosterone as it throws the natural endogenous hormone feedback loops out of wack. That's why people who abuse T can get gynecomastia, increased aggression, hair loss, infertility and perhaps most famously reduced testicular size."

"After months of recovery from COVID-19, my smell is gone again!","Hi guys, thought I'd update. In the last hour I have booked a test to once again get tested for the virus.

While I also agree with the assumption that this is a set of weird after effects from the initial infection, I would never want to put anyone at risk so would like to make sure I am corona free once again before resuming normal activities.

I broke my neck 14 years ago and found out today! Can i get treatment?,"If I'm reading this right, your initial CT had no evidence of fracture, a follow-up MRI 2 years later showed herniation but no fracture, and you have now had another MRI scan that has showed fracture of c5/c6 and nerve root compression at these levels. Is this correct?

Do you have any reports or pictures from the scans? It doesn't seem likely that a fracture that was invisible at the time is now suddenly visible 14 years later so perhaps these are unrelated.

However, if there is evidence of compression and your symptoms correlate, surgical decompression may be an option. You should ask your doctor to refer you to a neurosurgeon who specialises in spine as a next step."

[26F] recommended for termination of pregnancy in a country where I don't speak the language,"I’m so sorry you’re going through this. I agree with others: please get an interpreter.

This being said I’m moderately confident based on the limited ultrasound that you’ve provided that your baby has a cystic hygroma. I’m an Obgyn and I read ultrasounds for my practice. I admit I don’t like to make a diagnosis off of a couple of still paper pictures but if you search the internet for “cystic hygroma ultrasound” I’m sure you’ll agree it looks similar.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6029282/#!po=1.56250

High rates of malformations.

Probably the most important line from that article for you:

Cystic hygroma is well known with poor outcome because the fetuses usually have chromosomal abnormalities and hydrops fetalis or IUFD often occurs during pregnancy. The unfavorable outcome is 77.8%. However, there are also patients with cystic hygroma with resolution or survive at birth without other malformations (16.7—22.2%)

IUFD = intrauterine fetal demise = still birth

"[MALE,50YR OLD] had a 2nd heart attack post surgery and now unconscious and have him on a pacemaker and ventilator and said they will give him 4 hours and then stop all to see if his heart can work on its own,if not then will let him go. told odds are 10%,is life support not a option for this stuff?","I’m sorry for your loss. The following paragraph is a hypothetical explanation to what happened. All in all the course doesn’t surprise me as a physician. 

It is a possibility that a second heart attack or even a heart wall rupture to occur a few days after a first heart attack. The second heart attack they are referring to may have actually been his heart stopping, I presume they did CPR then intubated him. While his heart was stopped, the longer it takes to start compressions and to get the heart pumping on its own will decrease the chance of a good neurological outcome. Basically the longer the heart isn’t working on its own the more chance for brain damage and death (even with CPR)."

I'm a 14 year old female (14F) and cannot walk.,"I don’t think it is possible to give specific advice without examining you: there is just a too broad array of possibilities at this point. 

That is why I think that random suggestions for a test or a scan are not that helpful: we don’t know enough about you to give a sensible suggestion for further testing.

Definitely let your paediatrician know that your symptoms worsen and make an appointment. 

Sending them this post is a great suggestion, so they understand what you feel. 

Visiting an ER might not necessarily be the most efficient way to understand what is going on, but if there is a sudden or severe increase in symptoms, you might don’t have a choice.

HELP! Abnormal Menstrual Bleeding,"Hello, and I’m so sorry you going through this.

Off the bat: bleeding more than two pads an hour for two hours or being dizzy/lightheaded means you should at least talk to the on call doc, if not be seen tonight.

Regarding your abnormal bleeding. I’ll run you through basically all the reasonable possibilities:

Fibroids - you have one. This is reasonable given its size. You can have it removed or try hormonal control. At this point it might be reasonable to try a mirena again. Could alternatively try depo provera but I hate that long term. The nexplanon is associated with irregular bleeding but might be a more tolerable amount. 

Adenomyosis - endometrium that is present in your uterine muscle. Only options are hormones or hysterectomy. This is possible but less likely. Given that the Mirena did help at one point I wouldn’t worry too much about feeling like someone is going to tell you that your uterus needs to come out.

Polyps - not your problem

Cancer/precancer - unlikely 

Coagulopthy - unlikely

Ovulatory dysfunction - definitely possible. Most common should be checked for PCOS and thyroid dysfunction.

Medications or the hormones themselves - it’s always possible the drugs you are on are responsible for your bleeding but given your history this is less likely.

What to do: consider repeat Mirena. Nexplanon or depo provera may be ok choices temporarily but not long term (at least not depo. Plus nexplanon isn’t really targeted for heavy bleeding patients but can help). You should get checked for pcos and thyroid issues. Having that fibroid totally removed is an option but they can grow back or you can get new ones. You could also try the nuvaring or the patch but to be honest they are similar to oral birth control. Lastly if you want to become pregnant soon then being on progesterone for about 10 days out of the month might be enough to keep your bleeding tolerable and have a shot at pregnancy. Continuing Lysteda is an option as well however is hard for prolonged or unpredictable bleeding. 

Lastly going on something like Lupron or Orlissa (puts you in temporary medical menopause) is only a temporary solution. It can shrink your fibroid but it will regrow. 

Happy to clarify more.

Edit: someone else mentioned an ablation. The reason I didn’t bring it up is because OP is young. Also if there is an underlying issue (like thyroid dysfunction) that should be treated first. Alternatively if OP was 100% positive she never wanted kids then an ablation (Or a hysterectomy) could be reasonable. Those would be the most drastic, expensive, invasive, and permanent options however.

Edit2: also just want to make sure people reading this aren’t horrified of IUDs. Like anything in life, some risk is associated with every option. This being said, most women love their IUDs."
UPDATE (with test results): I think my husband slowly poisoned me over the course of 18 months.,"Please follow your doctor’s advice. I imagine the health department would have to get involved. It may be worth calling poison control and asking to speak with the medical toxicologist for your area, this should probably be facilitated by your doctor."

I think my wife is having a psychotic episode,"Hey man, not sure how old your wife is, but my dad had similar issues. Turned out it was a very serious gallbladder infection and he had to have emergency surgery. Infections can often cause mental disturbances such as this, and it's more likely to occur the older you are. In fact, this happened to my dad twice, second time was a UTI. Go to ER."
Me and my partner have been dying from an infection for over 8 months. We have seen over 20 doctors. Active CMV is as far as we have gotten. Help us not die please.,"Did you have any treatment for ulcerative colitis/IBD yet? That would be the logical first step in my opinion. 
CMV infections don't usually cause many symptoms but it certainly could be contributing in your case. You should follow up with your GP regarding the CMV serology. It may be worth repeating your HIV test.
Lastly, it's important to bear in mind that just because your partner has similar symptoms to you it doesn't mean you both necessarily have the same cause of your symptoms. 
My advice would be to stick with one GP and one or two specialists for a while and try any treatment or investigation pathways they suggest. Your case sounds quite complex and it may take some time to get you feeling better."
Is my mom having a stroke? I’m scared.,"Could be stroke, could be meningitis. The ER will figure it out. I hope it will be good news."

Strange bleeding from my chest,"Honestly hard to say. Obviously pulsatile in nature but super zoomed in to point that it's hard to tell exactly where it is on the chest.

Not something I've seen before, I'm assuming no prior trauma to the area, no surgeries, etc."

My sleepwalking is getting dangerous. Doctor isn’t sure what to do.,"First things first, you have to add some safety features to your home to avoid injuring or harming yourself. Knives and other sharps should be in a drawer, which should have a child lock mechanism on it. If you're eating uncooked food, another child proof lock on the fridge might help. Your door should be locked at night, and your car keys should be in the same drawer as sharps, so you don't drive while sleepwalking. Once winter comes, if this isn't resolved, your coat and appropriate footwear should be easily accessible by the door, to increase the odds that you'll wear them. If you live with someone else, adding a simple magnetic alarm to your bedroom door and window should wake them in time to get you back to bed. 

As for treatment, you first have to figure out if there's an underlying cause. A sleep study can be quite useful there, as can knowing if there's a family history at all. If you could know what time the episodes occur, say by having a home security system record you or a roommate wake up to the alarm, that would open some other therapeutic options. There's a few things to try, but treatment depends on wether or not there's ab underlying cause."

my ankles went yeet,"Hey there, I’m a Pediatric Orthopedic PA (need to update my flair). If you felt a pop and are unable to walk and keep falling you need to get seen by a provider and get some X-Rays done to rule out any sort of fracture and to check if any of your tendons or ligaments have torn. There’s not a lot of info on this post but continuous falling is generally never a good thing. If you are still at Disney and your parents/guardians have a car, most urgent cares can take ankle x-rays (ask before you get there so you don’t waste your time) but if you or your parents/guardians are super concerned there is a pediatric hospital called Nemours about 30 minutes away."

"Husband (39M, very healthy) suffered a stroke 2.5 days ago. Several question, one very personal","# TLDR

I include this section mostly for curious bystanders. OP, you probably want to read this whole post including the final section.

1. Minoxidil: I could go either way. Discuss with him & with doctors at follow up. The discussion is important.
2. For activity, OK to start resuming his prior activities including exercise, chores, etc., but start less intense than before and build up. See how it goes, which means back off if anything seems weird.
3. Sex is basically the same as point #2 but also make sure everybody is emotionally ready.

# Answers to specific questions

1. Topical minoxidil: **I could go either way. Not super scary to me to keep using it.** On the one hand, it's ""only"" topical. I did not see mention stroke or related conditions in the package insert for US and [Canada](https://www.jnjcanada.com/sites/www_jnjcanada_com/files/pdf/en/Rogaine.pdf) regulatory agencies. When it's taken orally, it's used to control blood pressure, which *usually* will *reduce* the rate of stroke *in the long term*. (Emphasis in that sentence is important.) I also don't see any mention of stroke + minoxidil in Pubmed. Probably your best evidence is going to be a [trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17761356/) which included an open-label safety extension of a hundred-ish people for a year (no mention of stroke). I don't see any big-scale observational pharmacoepi type studies.
   1. On the other hand, ""only topical"" is not a strong argument *in the general case*. If you (or he) are worried, why not quit this med? This is a case of weighing a known benefit in one area (cosmetic benefits are still benefits, & people are allowed to value them) versus a very small & partly unknown risk in another area. A lot of times the process of decision making is as important as the decision itself. I don't hear anything urgent here.
2. Activity level: **My opinion is find a middle ground.**
   1. Doing a 50 mile run 3 days after a diagnosed stroke *feels* extreme to me (opinion; no studies/citations).
   2. Mowing the lawn seems probably fine, but that can mean about a million different levels of exertion. (Is it a self propelled mower? Manual push motorized mower? Old school blade push mower? Ride-on? How much land? What temperature?) You don't have to answer those questions; my point is just to keep it reasonable. Try it but take it easier than usual. **Test the waters** (metaphorically)**.** Listen to what his body is telling him. Maybe take more frequent breaks; make sure to drink water.
   3. A five mile hike next week also *seems* okay to me especially if he feels he is at 100% normal physical level. Again, ""5 mile hike"" means tons of different things to different people. I wouldn't plan on 2.5 miles into the middle of dense forest with hills and rock ledges, no cell phone service, EMS would need a helicopter with infrared to find you, etc., etc., and then 2.5 miles back to the trailhead. Strokes recur on their own too. Even if the hike doesn't cause it, what is the plan if it recurs? I think you get the idea.
   4. Slow run on the track (in a few days) also *seems* okay to me. Same policies as above (start out at a lower level than usual, pay closer attention than usual, quit early if problems). There is zero reason to go directly to a 100% training intensity. Nobody should have anything to prove on either side here. Even if OP's husband is Meb Keflezighi and running is his livelihood, the training is going to be set back somewhat. It's unfortunate, but you should expect less training ability for a little while.
   5. OP, **what do you mean by ""identify a cause""?** Are there further tests pending?
3. Sex: Once again, it seems **basically okay to resume, with a bit of caution**. I'll make this point once more: ""having sex"" can mean about a million things in terms of what the circulation to the brain sees. Blunt & graphic stuff follows, so skip this paragraph if you don't care to read about sex. It's possible to (a) go nice and slow over a period of time followed by a sort of gentle orgasm, and barely get your heart rate up; (b) be over and done with in 3-5 minutes, maybe just masturbation in the presence of a partner, which is a pretty small stress on the circulation; or (c) go at it for 4+ hours, one person on bottom, then on top, then on bottom, then standing, with constant grunting, yelling, panting, you get the idea, which is probably not advisable in the week or so after a diagnosed stroke! Lastly, it is very important that both parties are emotionally ready. If OP or husband is going to have an unenjoyable experience, then by definition it is not the right time for two-person sex.

#  Additional comments

39 is young to have a stroke. OP, I'm sorry this happened to your husband & to you. Most of all I'm sorry you couldn't be there in person in the hospital with him & to hear from the doctors in person. The COVID era sucks; it's not your fault that you couldn't be there. He's lucky to have you asking questions for him.

It is very good news that he started to improve so rapidly on his own. All strokes improve; the question is how much and how fast. Great news that there is ""no lasting damage"" by which I guess you mean the strength in the arm/leg is back to 100%. It is also good news that he's been released from the hospital straight to home. Great news that he's in phenomenal shape to start with.

This *sounds* like the type of stroke that is due to arterial disease of the blood vessels inside the skull. This would be a very common cause of stroke. Obviously I didn't do the neuro exam or see the MRI/echo/carotids/etc. If the doctors don't think the PFO contributed, they are in the best position to make that call. Blaming the PFO depends somewhat on the location(s) of the stroke(s). It's totally appropriate to get a 2nd opinion if you're wondering about PFO closure, but totally *inappropriate* for me or anyone to speak with certainty based only on 400 words you wrote on Reddit. If I did get a 2nd opinion & was offered PFO closure, I would ask what is the evidence that it's a cardioembolic stroke, and  how the rate of stroke is expected to change after closure/anticoagulation. (This is to prevent someone basically ""upselling"" me on an expensive and invasive procedure that I might not need. I've seen procedures go both ways: undertreatment and overtreatment.)

Sometimes there is no ""identify a cause"" beyond what I mentioned in the previous paragraph. I'm assuming the stroke wasn't caused by cocaine or some other drug, although I'd be remiss if I didn't mention it. The treatment for this type of stroke is aspirin, usually statin, and blood pressure control (if needed, and on the timeline prescribed by doctors). Aspirin is great at reducing the chance of a 2nd ischemic stroke, and it is heartbreaking how often I see people not taking it, for no good reason. I suspect this is because it's not a ""flashy"" drug and also that it is literally over the counter, which makes it easy for docs to assume people are taking it per instructions. Point is: if he's not on aspirin, he needs to ***ask someone why he is not on aspirin.*** Aspirin increases the chance of GI bleeding; usually not serious; known risk that is usually deemed to be ""worth it.""

It's somewhat sad that the activity recommendations were not spelled out in more detail for him when he was discharged. This is all too commonly overlooked by specialists and inpatient doctors. I'm confident that my PT and PM&R colleagues will agree 1000%.

I'm an internist, not a neurologist, and I am not your husband's internist. I do see plenty of acute strokes. I just don't know every single nuance of stroke diagnosis/treatment, especially rare stuff.

Ask questions at the follow-up visits!

I know this is damn long. I tried to be complete. However, there is still a chance I forgot something and will need to reply or edit this post. I expect this illustrates that it is often not possible to make a short yet correct statement about medicine."
"Is it ok to delay taking baby for jabs? We are NOT anti-vax. I am just scared to take baby outside, esp to hospital/ clinic, but I'm worried I have messed things up by delaying her jabs.","No you should not delay immunizations.  Almost all peds offices have specific protocols that limit any exposures so kids can stay on schedule.

Either way the risk to kids of COVID is very very low.  Speak with the peds office on how to make this happen.  Delaying shots is almost always a bad idea.

Edit:  And it's not just me saying this.  [The AAP recommends](https://services.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/guidance-on-providing-pediatric-ambulatory-services-via-telehealth-during-covid-19/) continuing immunizations and (especially infant) well child care during COVID."

Why does my vagina stink when I’m having regular sex?,"I suspect this is because the vagina has a low pH while semen has a high pH. It is likely messing with your normal flora.

You have a few options, obviously some of these will mess with your TTC goal:

1) pull out, no ejaculating inside

2) condoms

3) no sex at all

4) This likely won't help but it *could* : have him wash his genitals before sex

5) Try boric acid vaginal suppositories (safe in the vagina, NOT SAFE taken orally). You could do a combo of boric acid plus lactobacillus probiotics vaginally. If you want to try this you can just buy any cheap lactobacillus oral capsule, but instead place it vaginally. Just place the boric acid and lactobacillus either together or alternating. FYI some people have irritation with boric acid, so beware!

6) There are pH healthy douches which we generally don't recommend but it would be a consideration in your situation. In the United States there is repHresh.

Good luck!"

Baseball stuck in anus,Go to the ER two towns over
I have severe social anxiety. I really need a step by step for a doctors visit.,"You can do both in the same sitting, they will schedule a longer appointment.

I am socially anxious as well, and I feel safer when calling for an appointment. I won't feel like anyone is watching me set up an appointment for something I might feel embarrassed about.

What you should include in your call, assuming you are already in their system, in order:
 
- Name, DOB
- I want to set up an appointment with Dr. (name) for 2 issues. (if you don't know your doctor's name, you don't have to name them.)

The assistant might ask which doctor you want to be set up with if you didn't give a name and the office has multiple doctors. You can say you have no preference, but that you would like a doctor who is good with anxious patients.

The assistant will ask what your appointment will be about.

- I want to get STD testing done, and I have some questions regarding irregular periods.

The assistant will ask you when you would like an appointment. You can tell them your preferred day and/or time of day. You can take a look at your daily schedule and find a time that would be most appropriate without having to shuffle around too much.

The assistant will suggest a date/time. If it isn't going to work, you can give an alternative. It is possible that the actual appointment making goes back and forth a couple times, so make sure you have an overview of available dates/times in front of you.

When you've agreed on a date/time, you will be all set to go. The assistant will give an overview of your set appointment. If your doctor's office does e-mail confirmations, you will get the deets in your mailbox. With this confirmation, your appointment has been set. The assistant might give you instructions for COVID-19 precautions in place at the office, or these precautions will be included in the e-mail if applicable.

Then comes the actual appointment.

Prepare a list of questions you want to ask your doctor and bring it along. Prepare a list of symptoms you are experiencing. You can hand over your notes if you feel too anxious. Bring a note book to take notes and write down more questions if you feel too anxious to talk properly.

You will arrive shortly before your set appointment. Read up on COVID-19 precautions taken at your doctor's office beforehand. 

When it's your turn, the doctor will call your name. Follow them into the room. Don't be afraid to tell them about your anxiety before any real talk starts. They will understand and act accordingly.

There are a few possibilities for STD testing. The doctor will ask about any symptoms you may have noticed. The doctor might ask you to strip down so they can take a look at your genitals and take a swab test to send off. Another possibility is that they write up a test form for blood testing.

For your irregular periods, the doctor will ask you about how long this has been going on. They might ask you about sexual activity, or other symptoms you might be experiencing, such as pain, severity of bleeding, acne, hair growth in places you wouldn't think of as normal, and the list can go on. When the doctor is done asking questions, they will tell you what the next steps will be. This can include blood testing for hormones, complete blood count, iron levels, and maybe some more. Ask about these tests and what they can tell the doctor when it comes to possible diagnoses. The doctor might also write a referral to an OB/GYN.

If you are uncomfortable at any point, tell the doctor. Keep taking deep breaths if you're anxious. If you feel comfortable enough, keep asking questions if anything is unclear. 

When your appointment is nearing completion, you will get instructions on what to do next. If you are missing any info, ask the doctor.

If questions come up after the appointment, you can always call the office again.

I hope this helps, good luck! I know how much anxiety can suck and how huge that mountain can be. You can do this, I'm sure of it!

EDIT: This was all written from a Dutch point of view. Read replies to this comment for some practices that might be different. All of them are helpful!"

I quit meth on Oct 11,"NAD but former meth user - you’ll go through stages. right now you’re riding the wave of being newly sober and it’s a great feeling but don’t get complacent in your recovery. it’s something you have to work for every day. eventually something is going to trigger you and you’ll have a craving.. it’s totally normal. my best piece of advice is to talk about it and keep it in the open. It’s when you stop talking about it and start being secretive that the darkness thrives, know what I mean? 
when you do have a craving, the technique that helps me the most is to “play the tape all the way through”. you’ll start remembering the good things.. how it felt, etc.. but always play the tape until the end and think about the consequences too. so for example - yeah, using made me feel good and confident at the time but then I spent all my money on it which ended up causing me to be homeless in the end..
your brain will eventually get back to itself, it just takes time. Start taking some vitamins if you haven’t already. Vitamin d, vitamin B12, magnesium.. there’s one called 5-HTP that helps produce serotonin. If you do a search for “vitamins to recover from meth use” a whole bunch of info will pop up. Do some research. 
You’ve got this! Good luck in your recovery 🙂"

"Daily diarrhea for 8+ years, no matter what I eat, drink, or take medicinally. Nothing major revealed by tests in the past. 23M, white, overall healthy, no major allergies. Trigger warning: rape mention.","You've had endoscopies, were they ordered as separate tests or was it part of a work up by a gastroenterologist? A second opinion in a university clinic would be useful. 

You should also ask them to check your pelvic floor and anal sphincter function. The constant wiping sounds like a muscle issue rather than a bowel disease. 

While you wait for this, I suggest you start using a bottle to rinse for the in between wipes during your bathroom sessions. That should help your skin and the sores. Sort of like a diy bidet."

Rage/anger in 3-year-old disappears after taking Benadryl - why?,"Antihistamines can actually be used to treat anxiety. Typically we use Vistaril (hydroxyzine) and not Benadryl, but they are very similar medications with similar effects. As others mentioned, antihistamines also have sedating effects which doesn’t necessarily have to mean making people sleepy, at smaller doses it can make you feel calmer but not sedated. 

It would be a good idea to discuss these behavioral issues with your pediatrician to see if your son would benefit from any additional interventions. It sounds like he could benefit from additional attention but this is best discussed with your family and your pediatrician to see what fits your family’s needs. I can say not only as a physician but as someone whose sibling had childhood cancer that as a kid having a sibling with cancer definitely affects you, even at such a young age. Your older son’s oncologists surely also have experience dealing with the family disruption that cancer causes and might have some good suggestions and recommendations regarding your younger son’s behavior.

Good luck!"

"My best friend died suddenly, and I’m trying to figure out what happened","Wow, those are quite some tragic events to happen to everyone involved. My condolences.

At this stage I guess you will have to wait for the autopsy.

My first guess would be a large pulmonary embolism (immobilized in the ICU). 

A primary cardiac cause seems unlikely. A respiratory or airway cause (suffocation or serious bleeding in the upper airway) I'm not so sure about either, because it wouldn't have such an extremely acute onset and your friend would typically run over in case she was suffocating for instance. A very serious and sudden arterial bleeding (ruptured aortic aneurysm) doesn't make sense either considering her age and history.

A major intracranial (subarachnoid) hemorrhage is a second possibility.

Again, pure speculation. You would have to wait for the autopsy report."

Physicians don't take me seriously,"This is a real problem with stigma of psychiatry in medicine, and I don't have an answer for it. Because I work in a hospital system, sometimes I have to be the one to call other physicians and tell them that this isn't a typical medication side effect and that they have to do a minimal workup before ignoring all complaints—but I have that privilege by being a doctor. As a patient, it's very hard.

Other patients might have other tips, but I think calmly calling them out might work. ""I've been on lithium for a long time and I haven't had urinary problems. Pain isn't a common issue. Could you please check for infection?"" And if that fails, ask your psychiatrist to run interference for you with other doctor as much as possible."

My wife's health is in trouble and doctor's keep assuming it's poor diet.,"Going to start off by saying I don't have a definitive diagnosis in mind for your wife's condition and I'm sorry ya'll are going through this! My main reason for commenting is centered around the radiologic findings as I'm a radiology resident and want to shine some light on the 'abnormal' findings you listed and others have brought up. 

Groundglass opacities are quite nonspecific and can sometimes be normal findings. Without being able to see the particular pattern, it's difficult to give you a narrow diagnosis, but they can be seen in healthy patients depending on when the acquisition was obtained relative to the breathing cycle. In heavier-set patients, especially when lying down (as on a CT gantry), it's not unusual to have some decreased ventilation. That being said, viral pneumonias can also appear as ground glass opacities, and viral infections can have both respiratory and gastrointestinal manifestations.

As far as the intestines full of fecal matter, unless they commented something like ""large colonic fecal burden"" or ""fecalization of the small bowel"", that might not be an unusual finding either. Again, it's difficult to comment without seeing the images, but I can tell you that the vast majority of CT abdomen & pelvis cases I read, there's fecal matter throughout the colon. To the point where I don't tend to comment on it in the impression unless it's an impressive amount or indicative of some other pathology as the above examples. It's actually more abnormal to see an empty colon. We're constantly producing feces, and that goes especially for power lifters who need to eat a lot and often to meet their caloric requirements for strength training.

Many diagnoses suggested here relate to inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's. In my opinion those seem less likely, as they're usually associated with some kind of change in bowel habit, consistency, or features such as mucous or blood in the stool. Radiographically, although a regular CT isn't the ideal diagnostic imaging, both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's can have features that would have been remarked upon in the report. Certainly a lack of imaging findings does not rule out the diagnosis, but it would be unusual for an initial flare of an inflammatory bowel disease not to show any radiographic evidence of bowel inflammation. 

As far as the cause of the symptoms.. here's my thinking: A viral enteritis is certainly possible. Given a vegan diet, I think looking for a vitamin deficiency is also reasonable. You mentioned B12 testing.. if not already tested for, you may also want to look into checking levels of vitamins B3, B5, and B7. You mentioned a rash that both you and at least one physician suggested may be allergic in nature.. allergies can develop overnight and for no reason. You may want to start a food diary to see if there's any correlation with certain foods and symptoms, and if so, experiment with cutting those out of your diet. Ultimately, if these issues persist, I agree with the suggestion to see a gastroenterologist.

Hope this was helpful, and best of luck."

I'm such a dumb fucking idiot and it has ruined my confidence (anus),"You’re far from the only person who enjoys anal stimulation. And you’re not the first or the last person who will take it too far *today*. It’s not fucked in the head. You’re not fucked in the head. You have desires and you let them override your judgement. That happens to most of us, at least once. 

The doctor can fix your prolapsed anus. You need to go in and be seen. A procedure *can* fix this part of your body. It’s easier fixed sooner rather than later, though. 

You’re not fucked up. You made a couple bad calls, which is very human of you. It’s gonna be OK.

Edit: after seeing your replies, it seems like you are afraid to waste a doctors time, or that you have a specially weird situation. You’re not and you don’t. Our job is to help. I don’t do GI, but even I know a prolapse is relatively common. We are here to help- yes, even you."

my [25] [m] wife [25] [f] has been sick for five months with something doctors in Japan have been unable to diagnose.,"As many responses have stated, you need a thorough rheumatologic evaluation. You seem to possible have connective tissue involvement and the salivary inflammation (sialadenitis) can be seen in Sjögren’s syndrome. Sjogren’s can also be associated with polyneuropathy manifesting as nerve-like pain as well as autonomic neuropathy which can cause issues like inappropriate heart rate or blood pressure fluctuations, particularly when standing from sitting or lying down. Overlap can be seen with other autoimmune processes such as mixed connective tissue disorder. 

Sarcoidosis would be another but much less likely issue that could mimic some of this esp the lymph node enlargement. Historically high calcium can be seen in this condition, but the presence of it is not necessary. 

If your GP can do so, while awaiting eval with a rheumatologist, would consider checking ESR (CRP might not be necessary given chronicity, ANA, ANCA, ENA (if available, otherwise anti-SSA/Ro, anti-SSB/La, anti-Sm, anti-RNP), Anti-dsDNA, 
anti-centromere. 

Suggest seeing an ophthalmologist as well especially if experiencing dry or uncomfortable eyes as ocular involvement can raise suspicion for Sjogren’s. Salivary gland biopsy and review with an experienced pathologist can also be helpful.

Edit: occurred to me that another rare, but often overlooked condition to consider would be IgG4-related disease. Can definitely see lymph node enlargement and salivary gland inflammation. Checking IgG subclass levels in the blood is not helpful as these can be normal. Tissue is the issue- biopsy with special staining (I think IgG4 immunoperoxidase or something like that). Typically will see robust improvement in symptoms in response to systemic corticosteroids such as prednisone or methylprednisolone."

1 year old sudden loss of vision,"Sorry to hear about your daughter. It is hard to know the cause without all the test results at the current time, especially the MRI, as this seems to be something less common. If she looks well in other aspects (except for the vision loss), and has already been evaluated by a pediatrician, ophthalmologist, and a pediatric neurologist, you are doing everything you can, and it seems that everything necessary is being done. Vision requires normal eyes, normal optic nerves connecting the eyes to the brain, and normal function of the visual cortex of the brain, and of course normal response to vision requires good function of the rest of the brain. Generally most problems affecting the eyes affect only one eye at a time, and can be seen by the ophthalmologist (either anterior chamber problems such as cataracts or posterior chamber issues such as retinoblastoma). Problems affecting the optic nerves (e.g optic neuritis) are more often seen in older kids (e.g with multiple sclerosis) and are very rare at 15 months. Rarely, there can be problems near where the optic nerves come together just behind the eyes (optic chiasma) when masses (eg. craniopharyngioma)/cysts push on them and can cause visual loss. It is also rare for things to affect the visual cortex of the brain. I suspect that the MRI will be of help. If it does find something, it might need other specialists (e.g. neurosurgeon) to provide further information on management."
It has been 10 days since waking from induced coma and I still can’t control my bladder :(,"SE is a neurological crisis and can injury the brain, in some cases, quite badly.  That's the reason we do drug induced comas when we cannot break it.  Without any imaging, it's impossible to rule out something anatomic but at this point, I would guess your symptoms are related to neuron injury during your seizures.   The incontinence could possibly also be related to having a Foley catheter inserted to take care of your urine during your coma.   

You need to see a neurologist and possibly a urologist (to evaluate the incontinence if the neurologist doesn't think it's related to brain injury during your seizures.)"
Alive red worms while peeing!,Too big for schisto worms. My guess is urinary filariasis (filarial worms in your bladder)? You need a med called ivermectin- it's really safe and a dose may help. But agree with seeing a tropical disease doc.
"Emergency room nurse openly admitted to the department of health that they screwed up my vaccines, i'm now worried about how i'm feeling","Like you mentioned it could have been the immune globulin injected into your butt. No worries if this was the case. Typically the immune globulin will hurt more, and is also a larger amount so normally it's given in locations where you can receive a larger injection (thigh, gluteal muscle). Can't say for sure though but that might help you narrow it down somewhat.  


The symptoms you listed are common side effects of the vaccine. If it's only been 6 days since the incident it most likely isn't rabies related symptoms as one, it is quite rare, two the incubation period is longer than that for rabies. I would definitely follow up because the treatment you received doesn't sound that great.  


If you have more questions, you can contact the CDC and ask to speak to someone from their rabies division. I had to do this once and they got back to me within 24 hours. They're extremely helpful and will have the answers to your questions.  


The study that talks about rabies in the gluteal muscle basically said...when tested, the people that received the first immunization in the glut did have lower antibody titers than the people who didn't, but all of the persons that received the vaccine had titers in excess of the minimum established by the Immunization Practices Advisory Committee. - DOI:10.1056/NEJM198801143180219  


What's interesting is if you look at the package insert of the rabies vaccine it actually says to give into deltoid muscle or into the upper and outer quadrant of the buttocks.  


tl;dr - good to go, your symptoms are most likely an immune response to the vaccines. Rabies incubation period is too long to have symptoms at 6 days. Sorry for the trouble you had to go through with all of this."

5 year old daughter losing weight and bruising easily,I would have her be seen by a pediatrician in person. I am a pediatrician and most offices have cleaning/ safety procedures to keep patients safe. Your daughter needs to be seen by a doctor and I imagine that they would order some blood work and other tests.
I ate a frozen meal that expired 6 years ago and now my stomach feels like it got hit with a tire iron.,"Obligitory not a General Practicioner nor a GI doc. However, this does not sound very convincing of food poisoning.

Let's look at the facts: 
1. The food was frozen, which renders an environment in which bacteria are unable to grow. Absolute worst case scenario, your freezer was unplugged for an extended period of time and bacteria grew, formed a toxin, and food was refrozen. At which point, you heated up the food, assumedly according to how the label told you to, which then effectively killed most bacteria (if any) in the food. Then you only took two bites of the food. Which limited your exposure to the food. 

2. You didn't have any symptoms of fever, constipation, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, loss of sensation of extremities, loss of movement/coordination of extremities. Which would be expected with any ingested toxin produced by bacteria.

3. The pain you're describing, doesn't sound typical of abdominal pain associated with food poisoning. But are concerning for other things. Diverticulosis, Appendicitis, Gluten/Lactose Intolerance, Musculoskeletal issue of the lower abdomen, Inflammatory or Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Kidney Stone, Hernia, Mesenteric Ischemia. Not in any order of significance. 

Because of the chronicity of the pain, I would recommend seeing your PCP. If the pain should worsen, or fevers develop, or any of the symptoms in line 2 develop, I would suggest more immediate attention with Urgent care or the Emergency Department.

I would also like to mention that no one can effectively tell you what is going on through reddit. The differential for lower abdominal pain is too broad, and needs to be effectively worked up with labs and a physical exam. I am not saying this is not food poisoning, I'm just saying this would be an atypical presentation of it. Other diagnoses cannot and should not be excluded. 

Do not listen to medical advice from those that are not medical professionals. Taking over the counter laxatives for any reason other than constipation is NOT recommended. Laxatives can become a very dangerous drug when they are used outside their indications, and unless a doctor is treating you with them for another reason, reserve them for constipation.

Additionally, because the etiology of the disease hasn't been determined, and it could in theory be Liver or Kidney, I would advise against the usage of Tylenol and NSAIDs until someone has seen you in the office.

Again, I am recommending you see your PCP as soon as possible. I am suggesting that this does not sound convincing for food poisoning as others have suggested. I am suggesting this is atypical and presents with a large differential.

If at any point any other medical professional would like to weigh in, and negate or add on to what I have said, I am more than open to that. As I said I am not a GI doctor nor a General Practicioner, but the advice you have been getting hasn't been great."

"My 97 year old Grandmom broke her hip, does she have a shot?","There is no way for me to say for sure without knowing more of your grandmother's past medical history, what her fracture looks like, and what her current state of health is  (vitals, blood work, physical exam, etc.). However, I will encourage you to ask the tough questions. Why does your grandmother not want surgery? And what does she want instead? Ask your grandmother what her priorities are in terms of her medical care so her wishes can be respected. You can request a palliative care consult, which are experts in having discussions about goals of care. They are also experts in providing care at home so people can be comfortable in the end of life and have the optimizing quality of life given a patient's situation.

Falls and hip fractures are very, very, very serious in the elderly. At 97 years old, a hip fracture is very concerning. Like I said I can't say for sure, but without treatment she is unlikely to survive and go back to her previous quality of life. Even with prompt treatment, the situation still would have been serious. If your grandmother wishes to decline any further treatment and want to die at home in peace, then I encourage you to fight for that and let your grandmother's wishes be heard. Talk to her and ask her what she wants, in the end that's the most important thing."

Second Opinion on reconstruction of genitalia after severe violent sexual assault as child?,"Your story is so unfair it makes me sick. You deserve much better. I hope you get what you need. 

If I were you, I would try to get second opinions from specialists, colorectal, obgyn, urology, maybe plastic surgery. You could ask to meet with financial assistance offices at major academic hospitals that have those specialists, create a gofundmepage maybe, look into specialized funds for victims of assault. There are a lot of people out there that will want to help you in any way they can, it’s just a matter of making them aware of you. Of course you certainly may prefer to retain your privacy, which is understandable.

I encourage you to see physicians that treat genital mutilation, see what they have to say. I would get as many opinions as you can, gather a group of talented physicians you trust, and weigh your options with them."

I went absolutely psychotic after general anesthesia.....why,""" Patients with postanesthetic psychosis commonly experience  hallucinations, time-space disorientation, recollection of fastidious  events, anxiety, and even paranoia. Improved methods of delivering  anesthesia and the development of simpler and more rapid operative  techniques have diminished the number of patients who have postoperative  psychiatric events in recent years, but it can still occur.

The exact pathophysiology of postanesthetic psychosis is not well  understood.  General anesthesia affects brain function at all levels,  including neuronal membranes, receptors, ion channels,  neurotransmitters, cerebral blood flow, and metabolism. It also affects  stress-regulating transmission, the alteration of intracellular signal  transduction systems, as well as more essential cellular processes that  play an important role in neurotransmitter synthesis and release,  including the intraneuronal signal transduction and the second messenger  system. Interrupting any or all of these functions can alter mood,  memory, and motor function, and cause behavioral changes, which can  manifest as postanesthetic psychosis.

 The patient is often irritable, uncooperative, uncompromising,  thrashing, moaning, incoherent, or crying. This commonly occurs in  elderly patients. Interestingly, there has been an increased incidence  in emergence delirium among elderly patients undergoing orthopedic  procedures and cardiac bypass surgery. The reason for the correlation  with orthopedic surgery is unknown. However, during cardiac bypass, the  heart is stopped and blood is circulated throughout the body by a bypass  machine, which alters cellular metabolism. This alteration can lead to a  change in mental state, or postanesthetic psychosis, in up to 60% of  cardiac bypass patients. ""

Oh wow."

My grandpa sings almost 24/7,"Some patients who have speech difficulties after a stroke are better able to put together a coherent string of words by singing... for reasons that are ~~are~~ not  terribly well understood, but thought to be related those functions arising from different pathways in the brain. Kinda cool, huh? (I've heard the same can be true for people who stutter...but I'm not a stutterologist.) :)

Or it could just be that your grandpa is trying to be positive (as you said) or maybe he misses having someone to talk to so he sings (""talks"") to himself. And now it's become a habit that he sings all the time.

Regardless of the reason, it's not an indication of a problem as far as I know. Certainly no harm in mentioning it at his next Neurology appointment, though. 

Purely anecdotally, my grandmother had a stroke and suffered severe expressive aphasia. But she could sing Happy Birthday, various Christmas carols, and the lyrics to many other songs she knew before the stroke without missing a beat. So we encouraged her to sing and sang along with her (even if she wanted to sing Jingle Bells in July) because it seemed to make her happy and why not?"

"I’m obese, but have been told by a mental health team and my doctor to stop losing weight. I don’t agree. I am being helped in dealing with an eating disorder, but feel like the “treatment” is tailored towards underweight/normal weight people, and they all aren’t considering my context. Am I wrong?","Let me be blunt. At this point, the anorexia is more likely to kill you than the excess weight. 

That means that it is far more important to get to a place where you have a healthy relationship with eating and your weight, which you definitely do not have right now, and an important part of that is to *stop thinking about your weight*. The number on the scale is an approximation of your health status for a large swath of the population, but it is not a good overall indicator of what is happening in your specific case at all, and given the remarkably unhealthy way you're focused on it despite clear medical advice from an expert team, you definitely have a bigger problem here. 

Rapid weight loss is very risky on its own, regardless of how much you still weigh. You need to stop. 300 cal a day is so severely under your daily needs that you are seriously risking not only your long term health here, but your life."

Something is very wrong with me but hospital keeps discharging me. I am very scared,"Where are you located?

What does this mean?"
No one knows what is wrong with me. I really need some help.,"I think you should find a good rheumatoid doctor. It seems like post-viral(dengue) chronic polyarthritis (maybe even RA, but I don't see you mention checking your blood for rheumatoid factors, even tho you said ""bloodwork"". Also maybe some juvenile idiopathic arthritis triggered by Dengue. In any way, all your symptoms are more likely caused by some autoantiinflammatory diseases (even Lupus).

ELI5: (unproven 100%) Joints and not only, are affected because your immune system thinks that the synovia (liquid+cells that produce liquid) inside your joints have some similarities with your virus, so it attacks them => inflammation => pain. Also because the immune system wastes resources, it is prone to get infection easier (mouth, throat sores, pain, feeling tired, dizziness, etc).

25M Animal Abuse tendencies,"Two suggestions:

1.  Immediately get the pet to someone else.  Don’t feel any shame about this.  You’re recognizing potentially dangerous thoughts, which is a good thing.  Many people don’t recognize or care so you’re on a path to getting better.  

2.  You need to see a therapist very very soon.  Doesn’t need to be the most expensive.  Doesn’t necessarily need to be an MD.  I’m only familiar with the child and adolescent psych side of things, but desire to harm and pleasure from harming animals is associated with conduct disorder, and can end up as antisocial personality disorder in adults.

Underarms smell no matter what I do,I have always had the same problem.  I wash my underarms with an antibacterial soap and don't rinse for several minutes.  I also stopped using deodorant and started using a salt crystal stick. The idea is bacteria is causing the odor and the salt prevents bacteria growth.  When i stopped using deodorant it took a few days maybe even a week  before the deodorant was really gone.  So it will possibly take a week ot two before you notice a difference.

Contemplating suicide I can’t be a burden and live like this anymore.,"I WAS YOU. I’m NAD but please hear me out because this was me exactly - fatigue gradually worsening until what was the fucking point? Unable to do anything beyond basic self care. Left my job due to fatigue. Couldn’t even shower half the time any more.

Eventually I was diagnosed with dysautonomia. That fits pretty much all of your symptoms - heat intolerance, circulation and bruising issues, fatigue, headaches, the works. Have you been checked? Considered for POTS?

Diagnosis wasn’t the solution but it was the beginning of my hope. 4 years on they’ve added diagnoses of ADHD and sleep apnea too, but I honestly feel like it’s that fable and we’re all just describing different parts of a much bigger elephantine whole.

Ritalin has changed my life. Awake and energetic all day, blood pooling significantly decreased. Headaches down to maybe one a week. Feeling the same temperatures as everyone else.

I (23F) am officially COVID-free but ID doctor said I have reactive arthritis? Is it supposed to be this painful?,"


If your pain is not being managed, then do seek help. Don't suffer in silence at home. It's your choice who you go to see: whether that's your GP, a rheumatologist, a pain specialist, etc. I'd advise *not* going to an emergency department because it's very difficult for them to access your medical records and they're far less likely to give you any medication to go home with, that's not really what they're there for.

But anyone should be able to give you a moderate opioid like codeine or tramadol to help you through what must be an awfully painful phase of reactive arthritis. Explain to them you've tried normal pain killers, like acetaminophen and celecoxib but they're not working. Explain to them the pain you're in, your inability to sleep, etc. For a documented acute condition it shouldn't pose an issue for a doctor to prescribe you moderate opioids to help you through this.

I will, add, however, that no matter what medications you get, don't take them alone. If things like paracetamol/acetaminophen and celecoxib weren't working well, don't stop taking them when you get something stronger. Multi-modal therapy is the cornerstone of pain management and means the pain should be tackled with drugs that work in different ways. Even if one isn't enough, together in combination they work a lot better than any of them do individually. Just make sure you don't exceed maximum stated doses of each drug."
[SERIOUS] NSFW - 31m. Adderall makes me have gay thoughts and is the only time I masterbate to gay porn. Is this normal?,"I remember a patient I met during my psych  rotation complaining about new thoughts of homosexuality and having to watch gay porn while never having had the same ever before. My attending thought he may be bisexual and just reassured him. Now thinking about it, he may have been on a stimulant at the time. I've messaged my old preceptor to look into it, no idea if he still goes there , but it may be the explanation. I don't see anything on adderall's side effect profile, but considering the mechanism of actions and the fact that it can cause behavioral changes including an increase in libido and the presence of obsessive behaviors, this may have just been one that was never reported.  Perhaps reach out to the pharma company producing yours (or takeda who makes some of the stimulants) and ask to reach out to anyone they know doing research on long term side effects and see if they know anything. You could also ask your doc to do the same. Out of curiosity are you on the generic drug or xr?"

"Told that the reason I pass out when I turn my head to the side is because I'm a girl, but I don't think so","The arterial Doppler finding is abnormal, important, and indicates that the problem is vascular. Combined with your bilateral symptoms, it seems to me that the vascular studies are looking too high; that there must be something going on in the upper mediastinum, rather than above the clavicles.

What parts of your body did the CT cover? Neck up, or did it include your chest?

I'd talk to a family doctor, and ask if it's worth seeing a vascular (or even cardiothoracic) surgeon, or perhaps having some imaging of your upper chest more than an X-ray. I'd be very interested in an angiogram from the aortic arch up, ideally while you're symptoms are provoked, but this has risks you'd have to discuss probably with the specialist.

 A family doc might be able to get some clues from simpler tests like MRI or ultrasound (but I'm not sure if ultrasound can get a good view of the aortic arch and branches, unless it's transesophageal).

Edit - I agree that a large vessel vasculitis like Takayasu should be considered.

I'd still start with a family physician, they can probably arrange some appropriate blood tests and maybe an MRA of the aotiic arch and subclavians (best done on a day your symptoms are flaring up), and discuss whether to see a rheumatologist or a vascular surgeon (or both)."

"Whenever I go to the doctor’s office, I can not stop crying. How can I stop?","You don't have to stop crying.  You don't have to stop feeling anxious.  

You don't have to change how you feel or who you are and you can still expect to get the same professional care, as if you stare at us with an unflinching, steely gaze.

If you don't feel you get that with a doc, there's nothing wrong with asking around and meeting other docs to find the ones you are comfortable with.

To be completely honest, the last time I saw my personal doctor, I started to tear up when I was talking about something.  I don't even remember why.  I think I was just opening up about something personal."

Is there any mental or physical benefit to sitting outside on your porch or balcony? How long would you need to sit outside to get any benefit?,"10 minutes of sunlight with arms and legs exposed provides you enough vitamin D on a daily basis.

Very probable that there are psychological beneficial effects, but I can not speak to its intensity."
"My PCP doctor believes I’m likely for a premature aging disorder, geneticist disagrees. Should I push for more?","I’m not trying to be a naysayer, but I’ve got to admit, nothing there is outside the realm of statistical chance. 

For example: Ignore the cherry angiomas - they’re not just ‘possible’ in the young, having a few is almost inevitable by the age of 30. Being bald just means you’d notice the ones on your scalp. 

The gum recession could be from over brushing? Much more common in those who pride themselves on their oral hygiene. (Not an accusation, just a thought)

The male pattern baldness, gum erosion plus early cataracts could suggest traits of a collagen disorder, or congenital acromegaly, but nothing major, given you’re otherwise fit and well. 

If you/your PCP are still worried, I’d suggest investigating any occult issues, with blood pressure checks, a full blood panel, bone profile, hormones (NB thyroid and growth hormones), vitamin levels, and morning cortisol,

Ultimately, progeroid syndromes are hens-teeth rare, and normally present with severe health issues at <5 years old. 

I know you’d acknowledged this possibility, but my personal answer to “seems like a lot of coincidences” would probably be ‘not really.’"

Wife had a brain aneurysm during surgery. Chances of survival and other questions.,"Neurologist here. It sounds like she had a dural venous sinus thrombosis at first - a blood clot in the veins surrounding the brain. Pregnant women tend to be at greater risk for clotting in general. Then it seems the doctors attempted to evacuate that clot but that there was a complication during the procedure. She isn't likely to have an independently-existing aneurysm which just so happened to rupture in the context of all of this. It's quite rare for 30-year-olds to have that problem anyway. The extent of injury from the bleed sounds severe, and it is impossible to say more without additional details and the images of the CT scans or MRI scans, but she is young and could recover, albeit with deficits ... And it'll be a long road ahead. I'm very sorry for this. It sounds like a horrible situation all around. I wish you and your family healing."

"My dad 60M got diagnosed with liver cancer today, I'm devastated & looking for anything that can help him","Not a doctor but I lost my dad to liver cancer (stage 3 when diagnosed). He too was 60. I am going to be frank with you , stage 4 is not optimistic.

My dad was able to survive 5 years post stage 3 diagnosis because he qualified for some experimental treatment back then. I recall it was call radioembolization where they use a minimally invasive method to attack the cancer tissue with minimal impact to his healthy tissues. He was able to keep an active life up till the point his cancer metastatasized and spread everywhere. 

I am not sure about your dad's condition but you can always ask about experimental treatment options.


But the most important thing i am going to say is to not force your dad to fight it. Let him know that everything is going to be okay and he should choose on his own whether he wants to fight. Cancer is a painful battle and of all the pain one has to endure, you don't get a lot of time or quality of life out of it. Respect his decision. 


When a loved one gets a cancer diagnosis we often forget the most important thing is to spend the most time we have left with them instead of just trying to extend their time. If you work outside of your hometown, quit that job and come home because you will regret the time lost making memories but you will not regret the lost potential income. If you are studying out of state, transfer back home and spend time with your dad. Tell him everything you want to tell him, ask him about his stories. Be patient with him because cancer is painful and it is very difficult for a patient to maintain mental calm. Bear with him.

Make sure he has got his affairs in order especially his will and distribution of assets. 

These are the lessons i have learnt. I hope they may help you."

>had barnacles growing from her arm. How is that medically possible?

Briefly, it isn't possible, and she didn't have barnacles growing on her or in her.

While there are some parasites that grow under the skin, and even move, these are not.found in ocean water.

The possibilities are: 

+ She had a parasite such as botfly that she got from visiting a tropical area, and it has nothing to do with the shipwreck
+ She did did not have a parasite moving under her skin. Just because you feel like something is moving under your skin does not necessarily mean that something is.

##Edit

A kind Redditor pointed out that barnacles can, in fact, do this. I stand corrected."

We have been eating detergent for the past month...,"I certainly agree with calling poison control.

However, there is minimal long term concern with ingesting small amounts of soap chronically.  Soaps are surfactants, and in large part these molecules are not efficiently absorbed by your GI tract intact, and are unlikely to cause a systemic problem.  There are exceptions for some speciality chemical soaps that are mixed with specific electrolyte salts that can accumulate quickly, such as phosphates, but even that often takes a large dose to have an effect.  

The bigger concern is that some detergents have acidic (more often) or alkali components which can cause damage to the esophagus or stomach.  This almost never occurs unless someone takes a large amount at once, however.  Even then, the gastric and esophageal mucosa is pretty resilient and even large ingestions usually don't result in long term damage.  (Some can be terrible of course, but again, this is often a large amount at once, not soapy water in rice over a longer period of time).  

I would still call poison control.  They're great at giving you next steps based on the specific chemical you ingested.  I have had a few patients over the years who have ingested things like this, and poison control often recommends that we scope them, which we do."

My sister 27f is a homeless heroin and meth addict. Was in the hospital with endocarditis that moved to her lungs. She checked her self out after being there for 2 days,"Unless she is a danger to herself or others, or is mentally unfit to care for herself, there is nothing you can do. Sorry. 

Endocarditis and septic emboli is not good. She still likely get sicker. I'm assuming her HIV is not well- controlled, so she is immunocompromised as well. At some point this will prompt hospitalization again or she will die on the streets. When? Can't say. But probably not too long. 

Sorry again. If you can't get her help, do get help for yourself and your family."
"Eye doctor said ""something's wrong with your brain."" While I wait to see a specialist, can someone put me at ease?","Ask for your records and tell me the diagnosis and what the retina scan was.  I can clarify it.  The way you wrote it doesn’t make sense so there’s been some miscommunication.  

Another user mentioned intracranial hypertension but that wouldn’t be shown on any scan.  That’s seen with the naked eye.  So I doubt that’s what they saw.

My guess is it wasn’t a retina scan but a visual field.  That can show pattern loss indicative of brain lesions."
Help me not die,"Doc here, what you are experiencing is a symptom of an underlying illness. Please go to an ER right now and tell them this exact story. Tell a doctor that you are feeling / thinking about this and let us help you. This is NOT anything to be ashamed of, this is not anything that cannot be addressed / treated and this is NOT something that is your fault. What you are describing is an illness that needs medical attention. If someone were to say they were having extreme chest pain I would give them the same advice I am giving you, please see a doctor so we can address this. You are describing details of prior trauma intruding on current life. I deal with veterans / military servicemen and women who face this every day. Please let us address this. Please message me if you feel unsure about what to do / who to see / what to say. Do not let yourself feel like you are alone, do not let yourself feel like this is your fault, and do not let your symptoms / illness beat you. PM me immediately if you are considering hurting yourself or others."

"Husband (32m) constantly feels sick. He gets very foggy brained, the weirdest grossest smelling breath, fatigue, overheats at night, and dry peeling hands and feet.","Uremia (elevated blood levels of urea) fits best with all his symptoms:

- Uremic encephalopathy: ""brain fog"" and fatigue
- Uremic fetor: bad breath
- Uremic xerosis: scaly skin
- Associated kidney disease: puffiness, especially if also around the eyes and worse on waking up

Uremia can be caused by any cause of renal failure. But of course there may not be a single disease process going on. Find a good physician and have him worked up extensively. I don't understand how any doctor could allow someone like your husband to leave their office without so much as a specialist referral."

I've gone COMPLETELY deaf in one ear and the ER has told me they can do nothing to help. Where can I go to get help before permanent damage is done?,"It sounds like a rough situation and one that should be handled differently. Reading your post, my concern is sudden sensorineural hearing loss. In that regard, I am only concerned about the change in hearing to the right ear. There is a likelihood that you have some degree of Eustachian tube dysfunction as sudden hearing loss would not account for the other symptoms previously, particularly the pain. 

You are also correct that it is essentially an ENT emergency that is often treated with high dose steroids within the first 2 weeks of symptom onset. You need an audiogram and evaluation by an ENT. Yes, I read the post and it sounds like for whatever reason you've been getting the runaround. I don't know how to help you there. You can try another emergency department, that may work; or explain to the receptionist that you have sudden hearing loss (which I am sure you have)."

Please Help Me,"You may notice a distinct lack of doctors on this thread. There's a reason for this, and it will be frustrating to hear, but you deserve to hear it. This is an extremely complicated case - medically, emotionally, and legally. The child has clear red flags for non-accidental trauma (abuse). These need to be investigated thoroughly, and the system, in an abundance of caution, has removed the children from OP's care until it can be determined that they are safe. The child already has a forensic pediatrician involved. You can be assured that the workup will investigate any clotting and bone disorders that could possibly explain the injuries ... bearing in mind that children with those disorders can also be abused.

Reddit does not absolve doctors of liability. We provide advice and off-the-cuff second opinions here in our free time to help point people in the right direction. Not so much to provide answers, but to help people ask the right questions. We do this without a full understanding or documentation of the case. In this particular case, doing so would provide a disservice to the patient, to OP, and the physician responding to the particulars. It is potentially dangerous, in a variety of ways, to all of those parties. And it could very well embroil a physician legally in the case.

I understand this is not what you want to hear, but it is not because you are being ignored."

The clinic should be able to do basic labwork and urine to start. I would definitely call again tomorrow and let the doctor know she is still sick.

"Drs of reddit, what are your beliefs on the future of chronic pain?","There are constant hype articles for new breakthroughs in all areas of medicine. Most come to nothing. The few that do will take many, many years.

This isn’t my area, so I won’t claim expertise in the cutting edge, but chronic pain isn’t a simple problem. I would be highly surprised if anything analogous to opioids for acute pain came to market for chronic pain. There are too many mechanisms and types, all too heavily centrally modified and processed.

We do have at least somewhat effective treatments. You seem to dismiss antidepressants and anticonvulsants (some of which are clearly effective, although not highly effective). But that’s part of the problem: chronic pain is *hard*, requires a multimodal approach that includes patient changes and actions as well as medications, and is unlikely to be perfect.

Yet despite evidence I have minimal success convincing patients that CBT-CP and physical therapy and biofeedback and all the other non-pharmacological interventions are worth the time and effort."

Why does the president seem so personally interested in action against Syria?,"I've been reading through these comments, and I don't think any of them strike at the truth of the matter. I apologize if this seems blunt. Hereafter I will provide a detailed examination of US interest in Syria.

[Realpolitik](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realpolitik)
>refers to politics or diplomacy based primarily on power and on practical and material factors and considerations, rather than ideological notions or moral or ethical premises. In this respect, it shares aspects of its philosophical approach with those of realism and pragmatism.

Chemical weapons aren't why the president is interested in Syria. The US has [actually](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:5tUKceCYXx0J:online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204524604576611443084688006.html+&cd=2&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us) been [interested](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/9064433/Syria-what-can-Britain-France-and-America-do-after-UN-security-council-veto.html) in [helping the Syrian rebels](http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/russia-calls-urgent-council-meeting-syria-20107320) for a long time. That last link is from the past few days, but they're all connected, which I'll get to.

The US has brought several motions to the UN. Things involving military force, military aid, or war in general are brought to the [UN Security Council](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_council), a 12 member group consisting of 5 permanent members: US, UK, France, China, and Russia. The permanent members of the council have a special privilege: if any one of them vetoes a motion, it fails automatically. As I said, the US has brought several motions to the UN, which I linked above. All of them have failed, and all of them have failed because Russia (and China) have vetoed them using their veto powers.

So the US has long been interested in helping the Syrian rebels-- why is Russia concerned with vetoing efforts to help them? This is what it's all about: the politics of power. Realpolitik.

Syria, ruled by Bashar al-Assad (who functions basically as a dictator) is Russia's only ally in the Middle East region. The Russians sell a lot of arms to the Syrian government, and importantly the Russian's only naval base in the Mediterranean is based in Tartus, Syria. So, for geostrategic reasons alone, we can see that Russia is interested in keeping the friendly Syrian government in power. Though this isn't the Cold War, Russia is a competitor, so to some extent the US is interested in seeing the Syrian government fall because it would reduce the influence of a competitor in the region.

Another ally of Syria is Iran. You see, al-Assad is an Alawite-- a sect of Shiite Islam. Iran is majority Shiite Islam. The history is too long to recount here, but basically: Islam is divided into two major branches, Sunni and Shiite, [which are not friends with each other](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%E2%80%93Sunni_relations). Iran and Syria are the only countries in the Middle East with Shiites in power, and Iran is the only country that actually has a majority of its citizens Shiites. It's in Iran's interest to keep the Syrian government in power, as they are the only other Shiite buddy in the region. This, too, is a reason why the US wants the Syrian government to fall; one of our longstanding goals is to remove the Iranian theocracy and prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Removing a friend of Iran reduces their power and influence. Recently to this end of stopping Iran, the US has [spent several years encouraging international adoption of economic sanctions against Iran.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-15983302)

Then, there is Israel to consider. Syria borders Israel to its north, and the two have had quite a lot of tension before; during the [Six-Day War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War), Israel occupied the Golan Heights and effectively annexed it, in contravention of international law. The two have not been on good terms. In 2006, Israel got into a short war with its other neighbor to the north, Lebanon, during which time [Syria threatened to join the war on Lebanon's side](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel%E2%80%93Syria_relations#Syrian_alliance_with_Iran:_2006-present). Naturally, Israel would rather the Syrian government fall. As the US is an ally of Israel and Israel in turn provides an ally to us in the region, it's in our interest to help Israel's interest.

Looking more broadly, there are regional issues. As I mentioned earlier, Syria's government is Shiite, while the majority of the Middle East is Sunni. Another element is that the majority of **Syria** is also Sunni; [the Shiites comprise 10-20% of Syria's population, while Sunnis are 60-70%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Syria). However, Bashar al-Assad and his father before him (also a dictator) are Alawite Shiites, and so Shiites have reigned supreme in Syria, building up resentment among the Sunni citizens because of decades-long minority rule by a group that the Sunnis consider to be heretical. This tension in the Middle East as a whole, Sunni vs. Shia, and in the country of Syria specifically, have provided sectarian lines for the population to divide themselves among. And because people in other countries want to see their particular side win, this means that [foreign-based sectarian groups](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_civil_war#Sectarianism) have rushed to help their side win the war, making it a regional proxy for the division between Sunni and Shia. Those groups, by the way, include [Hezbollah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah), a Shia paramilitary group who has long been an enemy of Israel, as well as the [Al-Nusra Front](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Nusra_Front), a Sunni Islamist paramilitary group who are associates of Al-Qaeda. Obviously, this situation could easily cross borders outside of Syria and develop into a regional war. Since the US depends on the Middle East for oil, this would obviously be a bad situation for the US.

BUT WAIT! THERE'S MORE! And as always, it involves oil (and natural gas). 

Qatar, a small country next to Saudi Arabia, (and coincidentally a good US ally) sought a few years ago [to build a natural gas pipeline from itself up to Turkey](http://www.thenational.ae/business/energy/qatar-seeks-gas-pipeline-to-turkey), and from there on to Europe. Turkey (also a good US ally) was also interested in this deal, as it would make Turkey a key player in Europe's energy sector by being the transit conduit for a large component of Europe's oil and gas, which would go through the proposed [Nabucco pipeline](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabucco_Pipeline#Motivation) connecting Turkey to Europe. However, this all fell through. Instead, [Iran, Iraq, and Syria](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:OyQkp4wvmvcJ:online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903591104576467631289250392.html+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&client=firefox-a) came to a deal to transport gas from the [South Pars gas field](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pars_/_North_Dome_Gas-Condensate_field) in Iran through Iraq and then to port in Syria, from where it could be sold to Europe, bypassing Turkey. The kicker? The South Pars gas field is shared between Iran and Qatar, so if Iran got a pipeline in place first, there would be no need for a pipeline from Qatar to Turkey, meaning both Qatar and Turkey don't get the money and influence they desire. So, obviously, Turkey and Qatar are interested in seeing the Syrian government *change its mind*, and unsurprisingly, [have both condemned the Syrian government and encouraged support for the rebels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_reactions_to_the_Syrian_civil_war#UN_member_governments). So, being that Turkey and Qatar are both allies of the US, it is once again in US interests to help their allies. But the US is interested in the Turkish-Qatari gas line for an entirely separate reason as well.

Russia is a big natural gas exporter. In fact, [they supply much of Europe with its natural gas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia_in_the_European_energy_sector#Natural_gas_deliveries), to the point where they are a monopoly in most Eastern European countries, and double-digit percentages to France, Germany, and Italy. This dominance has also given them monopoly-pricing, which has caused friction between Russia and other European countries. In 2009, [this got so bad that Russia cut all gas deliveries to Europe for 13 days](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Russia%E2%80%93Ukraine_gas_dispute), creating an energy crisis in Europe that was only resolved after Ukraine (the main country Russia's pipelines go through) basically folded to Russian demands. Now, this is obviously terrible for our European allies, as they have little or no options when it comes to Russia's demands. So, [Europe has been trying to diversify its natural gas suppliers.](http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/07/18/uk-energy-gas-europe-analysis-idUKBRE96H0SE20130718) Unfortunately, it has not done so successfully so far. Guess who was one potential supplier? That pipeline from Turkey. Europe badly needs another supplier of gas, though, so they'd likely be willing to accept gas from the Iran-Iraq-Syria pipeline even though that would involve buying gas from Iran, helping its economy. This is bad for the US, precisely because we sought economic sanctions on Iran to *stop* Europe from buying oil and helping its economy. So, once again it is in the United States' interest for Syria to change its mind on the pipelines. Additionally, since Russia is a rival, reducing its control over European energy markets is a strategic goal for the US in and of itself, so helping our European counterparts also helps us. Helping them, of course, means overthrowing the Syrian government.

Tl;dr The US has strategic and geopolitical reasons for needing to overthrow the Syrian government. Inevitably, this also includes trade deals regarding oil."
How did you end up in your career path? Are you happy with it?,"i'm a massage therapist. not the seaweed wrap and hot stone kind; the deep tissue fuck that hurts kind.

it was something i was always interested in, but working as a chef always took too much of my time. finally, i moved to the bay area and couldn't find a chef job to match what i was making down in los angeles.

it's great. it's like the reverse of beating someone up. i've had grown-ass men sobbing on my table because they thought they were doomed to live a life of constant pain. i've had old ladies thank me over and over, bringing me cookies and telling me my hands were blessed by god. i've even had high school athletes come in beaming because their tendonitis is no longer hurting their performance.

yes, i love my job. i make more in two days than i did working five in food service, and i'm actually helping people live a better life instead of just making them fat. "
"Why does the world come together spending hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars to launch rescue efforts for a group of people who simply made an unwise decision, but nobody lifts a finger if a one-off person makes an unwise financial decision or suffers an accident that cripples them?","Being blunt but here are my two big factors:

1. **The story is relatable**. Anyone who has kids who go to soccer practice can imagine some sort of weather event. We can't all imagine being homeless, or losing access to clean water and food.

2. **The story will have a resolution**. At the end of the story, these kids will go back to a pretty normal life or be dead. The homeless and 3rd-world folks will still face other struggles. Flint residents will have to move on to deal w/the many other systemic issues you'd expect from a majority African American city that's been on the decline since the 1960s.

As others say, it's not fair that this is the case. But these are what I see as the main causes."
"What atrocities are occurring around the world right now, and what actions can an individual take to help rectify them?","My heart is particularly called out to the Congo. 

On the Eastern shores of the DRC, on the border with Rwanda, there's a lake called Kivu. In the provinces around Lake Kivu, armed militia men have been fighting a scattered and desperate war for years, enslaving locals, killing indiscriminately, and all too often using rape as a weapon of war. They seek separation from Kabila's government, and in theory, want their own separate country. They are the remnants of warriors in the Rwandan Civil War -- a genocide that claimed a million lives, and in the years after, due to the Great Congo War, millions more. 

How do those rebels stay afloat? Partially through monies from foreign governments, likely Rwanda and Uganda. But on a more regular day basis? Consumer electronics our country buys by the millions. The minerals in your phone, laptop, ipod, ipad, etc., etc., largely come from the Congo -- and many of the mines that hold these minerals are run by vicious rebels. 

If you want to help put an end to the crisis, I'd point you to [The Enough Project](http://www.enoughproject.org/). Find out which of your electronics are most likely to fund a war, and check out steps you can take to see it end.

"Americans, would you like to see an end of the two-party system?","Absolutely, the two party system is terrible for this country.

We've all paired off like we're rooting for a sports team and hate people that dont wear the right colors. It causes us to vote not for the best person but to vote for the lesser of two evils or to keep the other team from winning. Would people still vote for ""their team""? Probably but it shouldn't be such as fanatical as we have it now.

So how do we do it? Go back to requiring equal media coverage for every candidate. We used to have it in this country,  I believe France still does. I'd love to just get rid of the super pacs but maybe it would help if every super pac commercial had to list the top 3-5 donors in text big enough to read.

What are the best arguments AGAINST legalizing marijuana?,"Here are some of the arguments that I'm aware of - I make no judgment on how strong the argument is.

- the science is inconclusive on the health effects of prolonged use of cannabis via smoking
- criminal enterprises will set up legal shops and use the legally gotten money to finance illegal activities
- making it legal will give children the impression that its use is safe and okay, even though studies have shown that young teens experience various setbacks from using marijuana
- there is no reliable way to prevent users from driving while impaired, or to measure drivers suspected of being impaired
- legalization of recreational use diminishes (somehow) the ability of medical users to legitimize their use (or some variation of this argument - isn't that one of the ones used to defeat legalization in California in the 2010 election on prop 19)
- legalization would lead to a surge in use, compounding already-high rates of substance use problems

Again, not saying that any of these are *good* arguments, just that they are arguments against legalizing."
Why are Millennials seemingly suffering so much more with mental health?,Millennials are the first generation to come of age since cultural attitudes about mental health started changing. This has been partially caused by research that has lead us to a better understanding of what actually causes mental illness. A lot of that research has identified actual causes for issues that were previously passed off as behavioral or revealed that known conditions have a spectrum of less severe effects. This has lead to more people being diagnosed because we understand what constitutes mental illness better than we did before.
"Should severely retarded citizens be able to vote?

My grandmother proudly proclaims she voted with her husband until his death and now takes her orders from my Uncle, her oldest son, who is almost like my grandfather was. I dont like to hear it but I would rather err on the side of all citizens regardless of ability being able to vote than we come up with a way to enshrine in law the ability to remove a person's right to vote for involuntary reasons (felons being an example of a voluntary reason for disenfranchisment)"
"As someone from another country, why do americans have such a highly competitive culture and are so mad about getting college degrees?","I've spent a very small amount of time in Germany, both on my own and living with some friends. What I observed is that, in general, people are neither poor nor wealthy. That lines up with what you're saying with, ""you have a job, you get paid ok, not super high, not low, and that's it."" The big difference between what I would describe as middle class, or comfortable, in Germany and that same quality of life in the USA is *risk.*

In Germany, you are never at risk of going bankrupt and becoming homeless because you got sick. You won't be fired from your job because you got sick and had to miss work. You get time off from work to rest (vacation), and even get mental healthcare. None of these things are a given in the USA.

The only way to decrease the risk for us is to get a better job, but even that is no guarantee. In most states, we can be fired for no reason and with no notice. So we always have to be working extra hard to prove to our employers that we are worthy and should get to keep our jobs. If we lose our jobs, we risk destitution and homelessness, not just for us, but for our families.

Because employers in Germany can't fire an employee at will, that has resulted in longer-term relationships between employers and employees, which results in loyalty. And because people are generally less afraid due to decreased risk in Germany, they can afford to stick around. We don't have that.

So you get a college degree so you can get a better job. You switch from job to job so you can get more money. You don't develop loyalty to a company because companies aren't loyal to you. The end-goal is to amass enough wealth so that one can rest without worrying too much. But the worry never fully goes away, because unless you have tens of millions in the bank, all it takes is an illness that puts you out of work (and our health insurance is provided by our employers, so if you lose your job and your health insurance, you're screwed) and costs a lot to treat (like cancer) and you could lose it all.

I had a friend who had twins a couple of years ago. Due to complications, she was in the hospital for a while and her bills were over $1 million. She had a job and insurance, but just imagine if she had been unemployed at the time. Stuff like that can be devastating.

I have a great job with a high salary and I work for a British company that has different values than an American one. But even I can't shake that fear that US work culture instills. Even though I love my job and they seem to like me pretty well and it's probably quite secure, I'm still focused on paying off debt (at this point, really just our mortgage) to decrease our monthly expenses so that, if I lose my job, I can afford to take a big pay cut and we'll still be OK. That's the kind of thing that has to be on our minds a lot: what happens if? what will I do if? where will I go if?

In Germany, the government provides a lot of that security. You don't have to worry about these things. In the USA, we really only have ourselves."
Roommate installed a key-logger. Suggestions?,"1. This should be obvious and hopefully you've already done it. Set up two-factor authentication on any and all of your accounts that allow it.

2. From a computer that you can be reasonably sure hasn't been compromised (perhaps a family member's) change the passwords of all the services that don't have two-step authentication. Change the verification email too, if possible.

3. As soon as you can, go to your bank and ask them what else to do. You probably won't get much more than ""Change your passwords and be more careful"", but it doesn't hurt to find out. Maybe there's extra security stuff they can do for you.

4. Even if you don't have money to actually hire a lawyer, many of them offer free consultations. At least listen to what they might have to say, the legal ramifications might be a lot more far-reaching than we'd know offhand. What if your roommate had been conducting illegal activity on your accounts? You'll want to protect yourself even if you don't think the situation's likely.

5. I'm not sure what kind of keylogger we're talking about here, but if it's a software one then using another OS should be enough to avoid it (as far as I know). Look into booting from a Live CD or something every time you need to do important stuff on your computer. Hopefully someone can chime in here and confirm/deny whether this will work for sure. That way you can leave the evidence and hopefully still keep using your computer, but I'd avoid using it for important stuff if you have an alternative.

6. Put a lock on your door, try to kick the roommate out, etc. Hopefully you can get the second roommate to side with you, after all how would he know if the same thing has been happening to him."
Why does it seem like more is happening about the college scandal than the Panama Papers?,"Because the college scandal is about a specific thing that most people can get their heads around; even people who didn't go to college have a pretty solid idea of how hard it is to get in, how much a middle-class family has to reorganize their lives to be able to pay for it.

The violation is tangible.

How do you think we should solve the “guilty until proven innocent” mentality that now surrounds men and sexual assault allegations while still taking women seriously?,"Copied from another reddit post I no longer fully remember: 
""So much to unpack. This is part of what I do, so I'm happy to oblige.

First, ""innocent until proven guilty"" and ""believe the victim"" don't conflict, and I'll tell you why. They refer to different audiences and parts of the process. 

In order for evidence to be collected and for victims to be treated appropriately for trauma, *investigators, counselors, medical professionals, and the support network of the victim* should behave as if the victim is telling the truth. Assuming otherwise leads to retrauma, which can undermine the victim's ability to be a competent witness for the prosecution, and can impair the collection of evidence. It's a perverse self-fulfilling cycle when disbelief prevents proper investigation and results in a failure to prosecute. 

But in order to preserve the rights of the accused, the *police, defense attorney, judge, and general public* must treat the accused as innocent until proven otherwise. The burden is on the prosecutor to prove the crime. In most of Europe, this is simpler because most EU residents have a greater right to privacy than we have in the U.S., and therefore only those close to the case will know any names. The media is barred from publicizing mere allegations with identifying information. 

It's true that this places an onerous burden on those who must interact with both the accused and accuser. After all, how can you believe a rape victim, and still treat the accused with any dignity or legal respect? 

Answer: with training. Compartmentalization is one of the key skills of the attorneys with the DA and with the defense bar, as well as the police who investigate these crimes. 

And finally, there are never times when there is ""no evidence."" Testimony is evidence, and a jury can convict on he-said she-said arguments by making a judgment about the reliability of the parties. It's rare for these to result in conviction without more, true, but it is enough. Remember that the *jury of your peers* is a core constitutional protection against false claims, as they are required to find guilt only when it's beyond a reasonable doubt. 

When I say above that the general public should treat the accused of innocent until proven guilty, it should not be construed as saying the victim should be treated as a liar. The best role for the general public, if not part of the immediate support network of either party, is *no role at all.* Patience is a virtue, and public virtue-signaling is a selfish and often harmful pasttime as applied to such cases.""

"Why is a celebrity that has raped (Kobe Bryant, Mike Tyson) still acceptable in the social eye, but somebody like Mel Gibson and Michael Richards shunned for saying racist things?","Mike Tyson took nearly two decades to reach a point he would be accepted on the Today Show or able to do a nationwide tour of a one-man show. He spent most of his boxing career saying and doing completely vile things and was largely pushed to the perimeter of the sports world. However, as others have pointed out, if you serve the punishment, it certainly leads you towards a comeback (and as a former Philly resident, I can tell you the Michael Vick stains are still quite raw).

Also, I believe Mel Gibson's decline in movie-making is largely self-imposed (he's been focusing on a megachurch he has in Beverly Hills) and Michael Richards didn't really have that long to fall (it's notable he joined a Seinfeld reunion on *Curb Your Enthusiasm* about a year after his incident and participated in Jerry Seinfeld's online project *Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee*)."
Why are we still so busy and working full work days despite having technology?,"Oh, it's not just technology. Methodology and organization have become better, too. As a result? Economic productivity is way, way up. GDP, or gross domestic product, is way, way up. Corporate profits are way, way up. 

What matters is what's happening to all of this extra efficient labor and profit. For the vast majority of workers, hours have not decreased and wages have not increased, either at the rate of productivity and profit increase. Instead, as is often the case, economic growth disproportionately goes to members of the top economic class. Some of this is in the form of salary, some of it is in the form of investment, and some of it is in the form of dynastic wealth or inheritance. 

[Check out the interactive graph listed under #1 on this site](https://apps.urban.org/features/wealth-inequality-charts/), based on data from the Urban Institute. Start at 1963 and go through to 2016, looking at how the distribution of family wealth has changed. Now, don't ignore that the numbers at the bottom are changing, too, some of the benefits of the economic have reached the lower and middle classes, but the vast majority clearly have gone to the upper classes. 

It's like a machine. In one end you put in more effective human labor and better technology, and on the other end you see wealth grow primarily for the wealthy. That's why you're not working less hours, because the rewards are not being funneled to reduce average worker hours."
Why do so many people treat the humanitarian crisis in North Korea like a joke?,"We feel like there's not much we can do about the situation- military action would be a South Korean bloodbath even if it didn't lead to nuclear attacks or conflict with China, North Korea regularly ignores diplomatic agreements, and humanitarian aid doesn't address the underlying issues, and may be used as an excuse by the government to focus on military development at the expense of agriculture and infrastructure.

"Why are ISPs so monopolized in the US? How did it get this way, and how can we get to a situation with more market competition?","It’s partly because they own the cables, partly because of regulations, and partly because of politics. Cable companies invested money early on to lay cable to individual homes. Since they own the cable, they’re not required to allow any other provider to access them. The idea here is if you wanted to choose between cable companies, you would have to have several different cables drawn to your house, and you would choose which one to connect your modem to. This is obviously impractical.

The other side is regulation. The same thing happened with telephone lines, but the government decided to regulate phone lines as a utility, meaning AT&T had to allow other providers to access the lines. This is why you could choose between long distance providers back in the day. The internet is not regulated as a utility. This was a battle during the Obama administration, but he lost.

In addition to regulation, these cable companies were able to convince local municipalities to sign ridiculous non-compete contracts. Basically a cable company would say “you want us to run cable in your town? Well we have to protect our investment, so give us a local monopoly.” And the towns said yes. That’s why you’re now seeing news stories about cities fighting to build municipal broadband networks, and the cable companies are taking them to court. These contracts also prevent other competitors from running additional cables. This was an issue Google Fiber faced in a lot of areas.

From the cable company perspective, the argument is this. It’s very expensive to build out cable networks to every home. So in order for us to take on the risk, we need assurance that we will be able to make gobs of profit. So we need exclusive rights to the cables, and local monopolies.

My only hope now is for 5G wireless to upend this system. 5G is supposed to be able to provide high speed wireless internet to your home. So you will at least be able to choose between the handful of wireless providers you have today. Of course the challenge there is data caps, but we are seeing at least some competition driving unlimited plans, so hopefully they will adopt a bandwidth model for the home, rather than a data cap."

"Do you think prisoners serving life should be allowed access to a peaceful suicide method? If so, what proportion of prisoners do you think would choose this option?","There is a serious problem we have in the justice system we need to address before answering this question. What the fuck is it for?

Is the justice system intended to punish? To rehabilitate? To protect society? To repay society or the victims of crime?

We have no idea. We stick people in these very expensive facilities basically with the intent of punishing them and sort of protecting society, but we can’t go whole hog and just punish them physically (which they might prefer over the loss of years. I know I would) and we don’t really protect society much since they come out more dangerous than they went in.

Prison doesn’t repay society or the victims, it’s a huge net loss, financially, and it’s barely effective at rehabilitation. We generally tell ourselves it’s for “justice”, not vengeance, but the outrage over too short sentences reveals that it kind of is vengeance, albeit a watered down non-medieval variety.

We spend a ton of money on imprisoning people but they don’t become safer, the victims aren’t repaid, and the inmates don’t even get punished really, as such. It’s an awkward compromise between all the things justice might be expected to achieve but it doesn’t achieve any of it.

Thus since we don’t even know what the fuck we’re doing (other than keeping the prison industry in business) it’s hard to say whether some specific thing would further our nebulous goals.

I think we should decide what justice is for, and then do just that thing. Probably train the inmate with some skill and then garnish their wages to repay the victims. And no, probably not snuff them unless we really need to- but if we need to, then yes, it should be available and painless."

>Is really wealthy - that most people there are rich and earn enough money to live comfortably and often luxuriously. That number of poor people are really less and even those who are poor have income more than a third world country.

There is generally a higher standard of living, but maintaining that is very difficult for a lot of Americans and you have to keep a close eye on your finances.

The President of the US has more influence and power than any other world leader, but his influence isn't large enough that he can act as president of the world. The president's position is more like a leader among world leaders."
Has the U.S. become too polarized to effectively govern under the current political system?,"I disagree, in so far as there have been other moments in history in which the U.S. has become far more polarized than it is now and extreme actions were taken by the government. 

The Civil War is an obvious example, but people often forget that FDR basically put a gun to the Supreme Court's head when they kept striking down his pro-labor policies. Or that the National Guard had to go to Alabama and force them to integrate. In those instances, you had a substantial portion of the population strongly disagreeing with Federal actions and we survived it. This is not even the first time the shutdown tactic has been used by a political party. I mean Christ, you should read about what happened when they tried to tax whiskey in 1791.

This is political theater, dramatized by the media. Most Americans are apathetic or don't care about this beyond a basic knee-jerk reaction. For the ones who do hate the law, I don't see anyone willing to die over it. And of course many people support the ACA. I have no idea if it will work or not, but I do know the healthcare system in this country is broken. I'm open to alternative solutions but there's not really a way to know without experimenting.

The political system has gone through much worse damage than this and survived. "
Why are comment sections on Facebook and YouTube completely dominated by far right conservatives?,"This is actually because of the exact opposite of what one might think. As mentioned already by u/inputfail, the most discussed comments will be shown at the top. And people tend to answer on comments when they disagree. When they agree, they just like it or leave it. 
So the fact, that right-sided comments are on the top is probably a sign, that many people that disagree have commented on it. Which leads to a conclusion that there are actually more left-sided people in the comment section. It's ironic, by their replies to these comments they are giving them exposure. Therefore I think your conservative friends might be right aswell. It also depends on the own definition of politically right and left of each individual.
Another point is that people often forget is the big part of the population with an actual right-sided political view in the US.

"For those in your 30's, how do you get past the ""Is this all there is in life?""",[deleted]
How come americans still suffer the horrible healthcare? Why dont they/you protest?,"Same thing as a lot of our issues, a clusterfuck of incompetence, sabbotage from every direction, political party divisions that make it near-impossible for anything productive to happen, and after all that we still need to figure out how to make a system that works for the entire country. A lot of us don't protest because we don't have the time, energy, or resources, lots of us are just fine with how things are, lots accept that it's crappy but don't want to make things worse. It's a huge mess, America has too many problems, too many divisions, too much confusion, and is just too tired to do much about it, we're one of the strongest countries on the planet but we're barely holding ourselves together let alone fixing things like healthcare."
How do you prevent your life from being dominated by your job?,"Try reducing your commute. There is a huge difference between a 15 minute commute and a 1 hour commute, and that alone will grind down your patience. Don't sit down when you arrive home: prepare dinner as soon as you arrive, *then* do something else.

EDIT to add: During the first five weeks of my internship, I wanted to shoot myself and seriously questioned my career despite *loving* what I do. However, by the end, I have made the daily grind far more manageable by socializing with other employees, bringing headphones, taking more frequent breaks, sleeping longer and packing better lunches with lots of snacks. It still wasn't the best job ever, but it was certainly more enjoyable."
How can the world stand up to the mainland Chinese government?,"Naval officer here, studied this from a military perspective and the short answer is: no one can alone. An allied approach is needed to counter PRC economic, political, and military pressure. They are playing the long game, we are playing short term. Their national engine is aligned to their strategic objectives, while we are fractured."
"Is the whole ""the bees are disappearing"" thing really as bad as it's being made out to be?","Yes. Considering that just last winter alone, beekepers lost over 31% of their colonies. They are crucial for pollinating 70% of the 100 crops that are 90% of the produce we buy. No other single pollinator comes close. Other pollinators include ants, solitary or small-hived bees like carpenter or bumble bees, and butterflies. However, because of their social structure (among other things) we are not as readily able to raise them as we have with bees.

The problem is that this is unprecedented, and not a cyclical thing.

TL;DR- Without bees we'll be eating things like ananas, eans, lackerries, lueerries, eets, roccoli, russels sprouts and the like.

"Should government-approved marriage be renamed to ""civil union"" for all people?","I don't see why religions should get a *monopoly* on such a socially useful term.

* Marriage predates all current religions
* Marriage terminology is primarily used non-religiously; e.g. in all law and legal documents, contracts, hospital rules, literature, films etc.
* There are religions that provide same-sex marriage ceremonies. Why should the *anti-gay* religions be the decisive factor to determine who gets to use the word?
* Government-approved marriages are called ""civil marriage"" - that is already specific. 

Alternatively; if religions are so offended that gays are using the same word as them, let *them* change their terminology. They already call it holy matrimony; why not simply use that term exclusively? 

The term marriage has already been used for non-religious marriages for many years. For all this time, religious people have been fine with atheists using the term marriage. One has to question the motives of those that have only now started to object to civil marriage when it's potentially extended to gay couples. I don't think it is moral for a state to become complicit in abolishing the term marriage just to prevent those nasty gays from using it."
What book did you read in your youth that you thought was incredibly profound but realize now was complete bullshit?,"Eragon. I don't know, at the time I thought that it was a really epic and well written story, but I couldn't even finish the last book. It seems so cheesy now, only one or two characters are interesting and everything seems to be *said* to us, when it should be *shown* instead."
"Why isn't recycling a standard thing in modern human cultures? Even economically, how can it possibly be cheaper to start from raw materials and construct a product rather than recycling already existing ones?","A couple of factors are at play.

First, the material may have changed fundamentally as part of the manufacturing process. Take clay, for example. It changes when it is fired to form pottery. You can't just grind it up and add water and get clay back. So some manufacturing processes are either irreversible, or very resource-intensive to reverse.

Second, even if the material isn't changed, it may be bound to another material that makes it WAY harder to recycle. Look at mylar, a thin film of aluminum bonded to plastic. The aluminum could be recycled by melting it, but it's so thin that nearly all of it would oxidize away in the furnace. But a bigger problem is that it's bound to the plastic. Neither can really be effectively recycled without removing the other (unless you just let all the plastic burn away in a furnace).

This second part is also manifested in end uses. For example, we know how to recycle styrofoam. But if you do something like mix paint in a styrofoam cup, and then add it to a recycling process, the chemicals in the paint can screw up an entire batch. Or take something even simpler; toilet paper. Recycling paper is relatively simple, until it's got a bunch of poop all over it.

Long story short, recycling is just another process. Processes are pretty much never free; they take time, and energy, and other resources. There's nothing about recycling that makes it inherently better in any way, even for the environment. Sometimes, it makes the most sense to use virgin materials."
"If being homosexual vs heterosexual was in fact a choice as opposed to a biological predisposition, why would that choice make it an acceptable thing to discriminate against?","(Historian who studies, among other things, the history of human sexuality! I hope I do your question justice, OP.)

What you're seeing, OP, is two related historical processes running head-first into one another. On the one hand, how human sexuality and human sexual choices are understood by different societies have varied wildly over time. Before the 1800s when the study sex became a science called ""sexology"", the idea of a fixed sexual ""identity"" was unheard-of, and historians refer to ""sex acts"" rather than ""sexualities"" for this reason (a man buggering a man in Medieval Europe was an act of sodomy rather than the demarcation of a homosexual).

Because of the rise of sexology and sexological understandings of human sexuality we now in the Western world have this notion of a fixed, immutable sexual identity -- those who don't feel that 'heterosexual' fits their desires and tastes find another word, like 'gay' or 'bi' or 'pan' to self-describe. This notion that a man buggering a man today has a gay sexual *identity*, rather than just being a person who enjoys sex with other men, is why (I suspect) that most people feel that their identity is not a choice that can be changed on a whim.

The second historical process is the historic perceived 'danger' that heterosexuality was under. This is a weird one. In the 40s and 50s, when Kinsey was becoming really big news, people became aware that most of their peers experienced some degree of homosexual desire. Suddenly the ability of people in the Western world to procreate was under a huge threat. To be homosexual was seen as a betrayal, by putting one's own pleasure above the needs of the nation during such an uncertain time. I suspect that this narrative of homosexuality as a selfish, misguided, 'pleasure-first' choice still underpins much of the rhetoric today. (for example, the notion that gay parents can't raise children properly.)

So you have the coming-together of one idea of a fixed sexual identity, and another idea of homosexuality as a 'pleasure-first' lifestyle, that creates the phenomenon you see, OP: people who argue that their choices are not a choice fighting against people who argue that those choices are harmful to society as a whole.

I hope this makes a little sense to you, OP! It's certainly not the be-all and end-all of answers to your question, but it's how I undertsand the situation.

tl;dr: the phenomenon happens because the notion of fixed sexual ""identity"" is running headfirst into the notion of homosexuality as selfish."
Has anyone ever just given up on their life and started a new one?,"Several years ago I cut ties with my family, left my friends behind, and moved to a city where I didn't know anyone.

It was the best decision I ever made. By removing myself from my toxic family environment, I was able to become a person who wasn't just reacting all the time. Anxiety level is so much lower it's almost comical.

Simple geography is a huge factor. My life in Portland, Oregon is much different than it was in Mississippi. People underestimate how vastly different the various US regions are. I always tell people if you don't like where you live, move! Too many different types of places for you to feel ""stuck."" (I can't speak for non-Americans, but I assume it's the same, albeit on a different scale.)

All of that being said, I didn't end up being a completely new person like I wanted. My habits, flaws, and insecurities followed me. I was able to evolve, but not to the extreme degree I expected.

Even with that, I am much, much happier than before."
Is it immoral to have children when a climate change catastrophe is inevitable?,"There are two things I can say to this: The first is that people have been worried about the moral implications about bringing children into the world for a long time. Back during the Cold War, people were worried about giving birth to kids who would grow up on a nuclear wasteland. Probably back in the caveman era people were worried about having kids when ressources were scarce and predators roamed freely. The point is, there will always be challenges that the younger generation will have to fix, and most likely they will fix it, because they'll have grown up learning how to survive these new standards. In modern times, that can also mean they learn how to fight back through the legal system (like all the students protesting for global warming).

The second is that our planet won't be outright uninhabitable for a long time. We're in the process of making changes that are going to make our way of living more sustainable, and we will survive for generations to come on this rock.

That will give us enough time to start colonising other planets, and with any luck, we'll have learned from our mistakes on this one, and we won't repeat them."
"Without intending to insult anyone. Why are americans so ""in love"" with their army?","A lot of it boils down to what happened with the troops that came back from Vietnam.

Vietnam was a very contentious conflict. A lot of people didn't want us to be over there at all. And then we lost the war. The troops that came back were treated very poorly, first by the people that didn't want them to be there in the first place and called them things like baby-killers, mass murderers, etc., and then by the people that were ashamed that we lost.

In the 70s and 80s, we started getting films and TV shows like Apocalypse Now, MASH, Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, and First Blood (yes, the first Rambo movie is actually a pretty solid exploration of how war turns the soldier into an outsider), and Americans as a whole, and baby boomers in particular, in the 80s went, ""Wow, we were really kind of assholes. Sorry about that."" And then, with the kind of restraint and good taste that boomers as a generation showed throughout their lives, they decided to take it a step further, venerating the troops, making a big show of ""supporting the soldier not the war"" during the 80s and the Gulf conflict in the 90s, and then, at some point, it just turned into ""supporting the soldier, even if that means supporting the war.""

There's also the whole military-industrial complex in the States, who find it advantageous to fetishize military hardware, and the fact that pretty much every state has some kind of tie to the military, whether its weapons manufacturing plants, military bases, etc. makes it even easier."
"What impact will this crisis have on society that we aren't paying much attention to, or will only manifest after the fact?","more accepting of home office

more accepting of citizen tracking

push to create a less global supply chain for critical items

more spending on pandemic prevention, 

more governmental and private stockpiling 

huge push for climate change fight (because we proved we can use less c02 in weeks!!!)

people more motivated to take responsibility of individual health"
It seems to me like the culture of the U.S. is becoming increasingly polarized and hostile. What can we do to foster mutual understanding and respect between disparate groups of people in such a diverse society?,"I just wished that we were all operating on the same set of facts. Once objective truths are realized, we can then form valuable opinions and positions.

When I speak about politics with difficult people, we always seem to operate under different understandings of what is objectively true.

Education, good journalism and being open to information that contradicts deeply held beliefs would be good first steps."
How do you not question the point of life all the time?,"You seem to be at a point where you have come to understand (and accept) that there isn't any inherent point/purpose of life.

I think that for you to stop ""questioning the point of life"", you now need to come to an understanding (and acceptance) that you can give your life whatever meaning/purpose/point you desire. Once you do that, you have a goal to work toward, and that will keep you busy until it is time for you to exit the stage."
Why hasn't there been any major public backlash to the NSA scandal?,"In my opinion, it is because the media isn't drumming up resistance against it. I'm not trying to downplay anything, but look at the Trayvon martin case. Again, in my opinion, that kinda thing happens everywhere around the country and the only reason that it gained the traction that it did was because of the media hawks on their bully pulpit. You can draw your own conclusions as to why the media isn't provoking wide spread reaction to the NSA, but I think it all comes down to apathy.

 'People' already believed that this was happening to them, so when evidence came to light that it was actually occurring, a lot of people shrugged it off as this is, 'the age we live in.' "
"For those who've overcome their depression, what did you do?","I prefer to think of it as being in remission. Even when depression is overcome, you're always prone to it again. In that way, it's almost like alcoholism. 

For a while, I was attempting to treat the symptoms, trying to fight hopelessness by forcing myself to feel hopeful, fighting a lack of sleep with sleep aids, responding to feelings of anger and frustration by trying to make myself happy... but it never really worked. At the most, it was temporary and I was basically in denial. It took years, but I eventually started searching for the root causes of my depression, and I uncovered deep self-loathing. I didn't realize it for a long time, but I was perpetrating severe emotional abuse against myself on a consistent basis. I internalized expectations and then magnified them significantly. Once I found the root, I was able to address that. The one-two punch of self-improvement and self-acceptance were the best medicines I could have ever hoped for. 

I had to learn to love and accept myself. After years of bitterly hating myself, it took constant self-monitoring, contemplation, and meditation to start to change my own attitude about myself. One of the best exercises I found, at least in my experience, was imagining conversations between my adult self and my child self. Talking to my inner child, giving him assurances and support was giving myself support and ended up healing quite a bit of damage I didn't know was there. 

I had to improve. I strive to accept myself no matter what, but the process of self-acceptance is made easier by setting and meeting good self-improvement goals. Eating healthy, sleeping well, and exercising for physical health, studying and taking classes for intellectual help, surrounding myself with healthy friends and spending quality time with people I care about for emotional health, and in general imagining the best version of myself as something to strive for have made me happier and healthier, and more fulfilled. It builds up my defenses both against internal negative self-judgment and external hardships. 

The thing is, though, it's never 100% gone. I'll never be a person who hasn't been depressed. I know that all it takes is the wrong trigger and I'm climbing out of the hole again. It requires vigilance, it requires an understanding that there will be days when I can't stave off depression, and that I just need to keep picking myself up. "
So at what point in this outbreak does a failure to act become criminally negligent?,"It is extremely unlikely because the federal government has left it largely up to the states to decide. If leaving hundreds of thousands without health insurance by refusing ACA aid isn't criminal negligence for the gov't, then I doubt anything DeSantis does or does not do will matter in that way.

I feel for you, I got out of FL as soon as I could. With the advanced population and the movement between NY/ NJ, etc. pretty often, I'd soon expect it to be really tragic. I'm terrified for my relatives."
Why shouldn't the minimum wage be a living wage?,"My beef with the term is the federal aspect.

Establish a new ""living wage"" based on medium US income and people in Alabama will be living nice and it isn't a livable wage in California.  Its even smaller than states...certain municipalities are hyperexpensive compared to the rest of the state. SF vs rural california, NYC vs upstate..etc.etc. I like that certain cities, like Seattle and SF, have made steps towards a livable wage which is how I'd like to see it managed because cities generally have the best idea how much their citizens make and can change laws  much much faster than a once every 10 year federal update. 

States are so varied in terms of economic development I don't think a one sized fits all solution is a good one."
"How is it that a style of fashion or decor can seem so attractive to so many; then, 10-20 years later, those same people look at it and think :""how ugly, what were we thinking.""","We don't live in a cultural vacuum. There is no objective measure of what is fashionable. So over time our perception of what is fashionable is shaped by our surroundings: magazines, television, and movies can serve to influence the collective feeling of what ""looks good"" and what doesn't. 

Do you like the same foods you liked 20 years ago? The same kinds of TV shows and movies? Do you wear the same clothes? Listen to the same music? Tastes change as the years pass; some of this is due to getting older, but at least some component of it is able to be influenced. That's why fashion is different in other countries too."
"What is it like, being you?","I'm sad, because I'm away from the few friends that I have. I'm tired, because the only way I can go to sleep is by distracting myself from my own head by listening to random 20 minute videos on youtube. I'm worried that I'm not going to really understand my classes for next semester, even though it's 3 months away. I'm scared my parents will be angry at me, even though I don't really think I did anything wrong. 

I think I may be a little stressed out. But I think I do it to myself. All I want to do is sit out in the sunshine and take a nap. I just want to forget about life and what needs to be done. 

I'm really lucky, really. My life isn't really that hard, relative to a lot of people. And it makes me feel bad, because I really have no reason to actually be sad/worried/etc. 

I'm lonely. I make up stories in my head, where I'm with the love of my life, and we're so happy. I know that I don't need anyone to love me romantically. My mother raised me to be strong and independent of anyone. But sometimes, I just want someone to hold.

But I really shouldn't complain... And I've got the rest of my life ahead of me. Sometimes, I feel like I'm older than I actually am. I'm only 19... Why do I concern myself with these things?

So yeah. I guess I'm just a little confused."

"(Serious) Parents of severely disabled children, do you ever wish the child had not been born?","My cousin has 4 children all by different fathers by the age of 23. She Never had any stability and never made positive decisions as far as the men she chose to be with. Needless to say, she was a struggling single mom with barely any education working a minimum wage job. A real mess. She had a baby girl in 2011 that had Dandy Walker syndrome complicated by severe hydrocephalus and daily grand mal seizures. The kid was also severely mentally disabled and unable to walk or talk. She was in a perpetual state of infancy. 

For some reason or another her disease progressed to the point where she could not swallow and needed a Mickey tube placed in her stomach. Her mother had to constantly balance caring for her other 3 children as a single mother and the extreme needs of a disabled child. Then her disease progressed to where she could not cough effectively and was constantly having to have secretions suctioned from her throat. Her mom qualified for government assistance so she was able to get a home health nurse, but the kid still needed ample support. 

One day, she became really sick to the point where the doctor informed my cousin that without mechanical ventilation, her daughter would not survive. After weighing all of her options, considering how caring for a mechanically ventilated child would affect the life of her other children, and realizing how poor the quality of life her daughter already had, she decided to stop all life sustaining measures. The nurses gave her morphine to ease her respiratory distress in the end. It took 3 hours for her to pass away and I will never forget the sounds of her death rattle. Our entire family was at her bedside and we all sang to her, held her, and told her how much we loved her and that it was okay to transition over. She died with dignity. 

There are a lot of things worst than death and I’m so happy her mother was able to see that and let her go in peace. I would have made the exact same decision. Kylee was 4 years old. Had never walked, never talked, never communicated in any meaningful way. All she knew in her life was pain. I’m glad she’s free."
Do you see an end to the massive political polarization we see today? What will it be?,"Cultural historian and big fan of sociology here, so this answer is gonna have a little bit of detail. The United States has almost always exhibited [a degree of political polarization](https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4273163/polar_housesenate_difference.png). This political polarization is largely related to economic pressures resulting from income inequality, which drives citizens to choose more ideologically extreme options. This [chart](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Share_top_1_percent.jpg) shows the share of pretax household income received by the top 1%, top 0.1% and top 0.01% in the US. As we can see, the level of income inequality mirrors the level of political polarization. 

If you look to the beginning of the charts at the late 1800s and early 1900s respectively, levels of political polarization and income inequality were high. This period of time was known as the [Gilded Age,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded_Age) which was known for its lack of substantive regulation regarding business structure and labor laws in the face of massive industrial growth. This subjected harsh working conditions onto the US's working poor and allowed untold riches to its [elite.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_of_industry) This, in turn with an often jingoistic and dis-informative [press,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_journalism) radicalized the two flanks of the population until progressive [reforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_Deal) were enacted under Theodore Roosevelt. Polarization rose slightly in WWI and the year after due to the First Red Scare, but dropped under the Roaring Twenties and further when Franklin Delano Roosevelt enacted the New Deal in the Depression, to further reduce income inequality. 

Any of this sound familiar? Well we are currently in a second Gilded Age triggered by the ideology of [continual deregulatory reforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism#United_States) that were initiated in the 1970s and cuts in social spending (outside of healthcare) that culminated in Bill Clinton's passage of the [""end of welfare as we know it.""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Responsibility_and_Work_Opportunity_Act) In the realm of social issues, one of these deregulatory reforms was the 1987 abolition of [FCC fairness doctrine,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCC_fairness_doctrine) which required all news broadcasters report only facts, with as little bias as possible. This led to the rise of conservative talk radio and subsequent [moral panics of the late-1980s and early-1990s.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_panic#1980s%E2%80%931990s:_Satanic_ritual_abuse) At that point in the first chart, we can see polarization begin its climb to its current levels today. This was made worse by the infamous [Citizens United v. FCC case,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC) which allowed unlimited corporate PAC money in elections. This, combined with the fact that the [average American family never really recovered from the Recession,](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/12/great-recession-still-with-us/547268/) causes immense pressure for radicalization. 

So to answer your question, political polarization will begin to drop when the United States begins to regulate its businesses again in a way reduces economic pressures on the 99.9%. This would be through manners similar to those enacted by both Roosevelts, which would be to break up the big banks and giant media conglomerates like Comcast and Disney, massively increase taxes on the .01%, and end all tax loopholes. It'd also require heavy expansions to the welfare state (Single-payer, more education funding, reintroduction of [AFDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aid_to_Families_with_Dependent_Children), etc.) nothing socialistic, but enough to make sure every American's needs are met. I realize this sounds like a political platform, but it's been done before 100 years ago and simply put, people tend to be less politically radical when their economy is functioning correctly and their needs are met. Until this happens, it will only get worse from here. "
"Why are some cities sprawled out disconnected messes like Los Angeles, and other cities neatly organized, like Chicago?","Urban Planning switches its focus every few decades.  I think most planners would agree that the big pushes now are to respond either to global warming, or increasing obesity rates.  Prior to about 1970, these problems weren't on the radar.  Instead, the dialogue was about how to reduce city crowding, reduce disease, and prevent fire from spreading so quickly.  Chicago and Los Angeles are simply examples of how this planners attempted to respond to the problem of the day.  

Before we consider either city, let's first look at how cities develop without planning.  Shanty towns are a good example.  If you've never been to one, understand that people build their homes wherever land is available, with whatever material is available.  This leads to streets that are difficult to navigate.  You'll even find people who can't find land, so build in the middle of the street.  Fire spreads easily, and people throw their waste into the street, helping to breed rats and spread disease.  Prior to the 20th century, many European cities fit this bill.  Planners of Los Angeles and Chicago were working in response to this background.  Cars were starting to appear, but weren't nearly as much of a fixture as they are today.  

So with that context, I'll start with Chicago since that's what I know.  The main person responsible for Chicago as it is today is Daniel Burnham who said, ""Make no little plans. They have no magic to stir men's blood and probably will not themselves be realized.""  As an architect and a planner, he came to Chicago at the right time.  The Great Chicago Fire of 1871 destroyed a lot of the town.  Fires continued to destroy parts of the city.  Meanwhile, approximately 1890 to the 1920s was a good time to be a farmer in the US (thanks to Thomas Jefferson who, in another plan to stop hunger, planned to give every male American citizen a plot of land to feed himself and his family).  It was so profitable a time that people were moving from all over the place.  And Chicago just so happened to be the city along Lake Michigan that would let them ship their grain to the east, to feed the teeming East Coast population.  So for Chicago, think blank slate with a lot of money coming in.  

Then comes the World's Fair.  Daniel Burnham designs some beautiful buildings in a marshy area on the southside.   [Here's what he designed](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Court_of_Honor_and_Grand_Basin.jpg
)  And people loved it.  27 million people visited from around the world.  Of course, the they missed the rest of the city, much of which was just like the preceding centuries, disease, crime, and fire.  And few of Burnham's buildings survived long after the fair.  They were made of plaster so it wasn't a surprise.  But regardless, Burnham struck a chord with the Chicago public.  10 years later, he was trying to impose his vision of an orderly city, with inspiring civic buildings at its center, like Ancient Greece on a grid.  His success at the World's Fair made it an easy sell.  He even showed up at elementary schools to teach children his plan.  By the time things were underway, Chicagoans were almost unanimously subscribed to Burnham's plan.  Streets were laid down, and land plotted out.  People built more houses to fill the city.  Two things favored density in the city.  One was that skyscrapers were just entering their heyday when Chicago was growing.  Two is that winter heat is less expensive if your home is attached to a neighbors.  But with streets designated, and houses in the ground, things were set for Chicago ever since.  The interstate system breaks up the grid somewhat, but otherwise it's a difficult thing to disrupt, even with the rise of the automobile.  

So what's different about Los Angeles?  It actually did have the country's largest rail transit system in the US in the early 1900s.  But that transit system was a reflection of a different idea in place at the time.  While Burnham focused on making the city beautiful, Los Angeles was supposed to be a garden city.  Instead of one grand center, imagine, dozens of inviting, less intense mini-centers spread out to the periphery.  One could have a home with a front lawn, but then walk to the train station and be at work downtown in thirty minutes, also known as streetcar suburbs.  Real estate developers, like Henry Huntington sold this idea in magazines and over the radio, boasting of LA's moderate climate in comparison to the harsh northern winters.  (The Chicago region also saw the allure of garden cities, and so you'll actually find several examples along Chicago's commuter rail lines out in the suburbs.)

And this gets us to three major challenges for both ideas.  First was the car.  The allure was simple.  You could go anywhere anytime you wanted.  No longer were you limited to what was around the streetcar system.  No longer did you have to know the schedule to go anywhere.  And then you have World War II and the GI Bill, giving veterans subsidized home loans.  Houses in the country were no longer for the rich, but for anyone who fought in the war, which was a pretty large amount of people at the time.  

But the car doesn't explain it all.  Desegregation was another big event in the mid 20th century.  No longer was it legal to force black people into one neighborhood.  And many black people, also eligible for the GI bill, started trying to find better neighborhoods within the city.  Real estate agents would warn homeowners that black people were moving in, and that they were better off selling their homes now rather than later.  

This is where the stories of LA and Chicago start to come together.  Now in addition to garden cities, both regions start to see small municipalities pop up along the suburban fringe.  Whereas the streetcar suburbs could hold maybe 50,000 people, these new municipalities held 10,000 to 20,000.  And they were designed largely to keep urban traffic out.  Instead of a grid, you'd see cul de sacs leading to highways leading to the city.  Want to visit your neighbor 500 feet away?  Well, you can't cross anyone's back yard, so may have to drive a half mile or more just to get to the next cul de sac.  Such exclusivity cost money, and it had the larger impact of disconnecting cities from their periphery.  Los Angeles wasn't as grid like to begin with, so had no reason to seek a grid system all of the sudden.  

The third historical challenge for both cities was to maintain a public transit system.  From the beginning, LA's system was not profitable.  But people like Huntington knew that to be able to sell land far away from the city center people needed access. So they subsidized LA's transit system.  When GE came to buy the streetcars later and replace them with buses, and veterans settled in the area permanently, it was hard to justify maintaining fixed route service.  LA lost a lot of its once great transit system.  

So what saved Chicago's transit system?  Politics and parking.  Politics because the mayor at the time, Richard J. Daley, was infamous for his quid pro quo style of running the city.  Transit while declining elsewhere, was something Daley kept around to ensure he had a reward for poor people who voted for him.  Parking comes into play since downtown Chicago has always been a major employment center.  There simply wouldn't be enough parking if the transit system were to collapse, so even though it was losing money due to people switching to cars, it would never be possible for Chicago to have enough downtown parking but for some major collapse of downtown employers.  Los Angeles, conversely, is not nearly as centralized when it comes to employment, hence why there was less pressure to keep a massive transit system in operation, and why it was okay to switch to simple bus service.  

Hopefully that answers part of your question.  As I hope I've imparted to you, there are a lot of reasons theses cities are different, and there are many more things at play than just the introduction of cars.  Thanks for reading!"

Could we as a global society eventually not require people to work for a living?,"One way towards this might be the idea of a basic income, that is actually part of the programme of the German Pirate party, and possibly other pirate parties elsewhere too. I think that the Pirate party is so far ahead of its time that their political programme sometimes sounds ridiculous. But their idea is to have every member of the society receiving a basic income, and they can earn more or not, as they like. The idea is that people are freed of the necessity to earn a living, and then can contribute in the best way to society and to their own personal well being. Some might want to get into high paying jobs, some might want to smoke up and do nothing, some might follow their art, politics, caring professions, etc. This would also reduce the possibilities of exploitation by businesses, because when people aren't on the verge of bankruptcy, they won't let themselves be exploited.

It all sounds a bit utopian right now, but I think that is the way forward. Almost every industrialized country can easily afford to pay every citizen a basic wage. So we have the money, we have the imagination, at least on the political fringe, and we have the future.

Why do Americans have a negative attitude towards math and how can I keep my kids from adopting it?,"People here are saying math is hard, math is non-intuitive, math is useless in real life, math is not taught in a fun way, etc. I disagree that these are the reason behind math's lack of popularity. They're very superficial, and mostly a consequence and not the origin of the problem.

**Background**: I've been making [educational math and physics illustrations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:LucasVB/Gallery) for the past 10+ years. I've tutored a few people as well and I've worked on some other educational multimedia projects along the way. A lot of my work has been praised for being clear, intuitive and ""more helpful than years of classes"". So judging from the response of others, I'd say my approach to math/physics education has some merit.

----

Now, as others pointed out, this is not really an issue with the US. The lack of appreciation for mathematics is widespread and nearly universal.

I was brought up with the world view that the world is out there to be understood, if only we pay attention to the way it expresses itself. My parents taught me that math, physics, chemistry, biology and etc. are just different ways to understand how different facets of the world around us work.

So from the beginning, my parents taught me and my siblings that the world could be made sense of, and if we put the effort in it, we could understand it.

Humans are naturally curious. Children in all cultures universally ask ""why?"" questions to the exhaustion of their parents's willpower to answer. The usual response is to eventually curb that curiosity for the sake of simplifying the worldview of the children and simplifying the lives of the parents, who get sick of indulging in that curiosity after a while. 

This is a huge mistake.

This worldview that ""BECAUSE IT IS"" or ""BECAUSE X SAID SO"", when taken to heart, naturally inhibits the predisposition of the person to invest in understanding or knowing things. I can't cite studies on this, as I've never heard of anything of the sort being done, but from personal experience people who excel in math and physics (or science, in general) are just very curious people. If you ever dealt with kids asking questions, you'll notice that the curiosity in these people just didn't wear off. It has the same flavor.

That curiosity survived because it was rewarded over the years, and the reward for curiosity is wonder. It is exciting to figure things out. But we use the expression ""childhood wonder"" almost derogatorily these, as if it is naïve to be amazed and excited about things.

So one thing you can do to your kids is merely to indulge their curiosity. Give them the worldview that there's stuff to figure out, and there's ways to obtain answers if you don't know things.

When they ask something you don't know, don't say ""it just is"" or lie. Admit that you don't know. Say ""I don't know, but we can find out!"" and make it an activity to do together, or help them do it themselves. Go search online, or make experiments, **give them the confidence that they have the power to figure things out**.

----

Now, with the proper mindset in place, these kids will face a very different and unenlightening approach when they finally get to study in a school environment. Due to time, knowledge and social constraints, kids will inevitably get a pretty shitty and superficial education, in math or anything else.

But what makes math particularly difficult is that it adds up, it builds on top of itself. If you never understood geometry and algebra, trigonometry and calculus will become fuzzy and weird.

When math is properly understood, every next step is sensible and makes perfect sense. This is exactly the inverse of the perspective everyone seems to have, which is a tragedy on its own. This is clearly reflected in the other comments here.

My point is that math IS intuitive, by default, and when you think it isn't it's your intuition that is wrong. This means your understanding of some aspect of math is incomplete or incorrect. Mathematics is just a series of logical steps with a clear intent, and this is something everyone should be convinced to be true.

It seems to me that the origin of this whole hate affair with math and physics lies at the way people approach the subject.

Math and physics are taught from the perspective I call ""this thing exists"". This strategy basically pulls a concept out of thin air, plops it in front of students and have them memorize the fact that concept exists in so and so way. Then they plop another concept and explain a rule, that was also pulled out of thin air and also needs to be memorized, that connects both. This goes on and on, until your entire mathematical framework is a collection of impenetrable and incomprehensible rules and jargon.

So it's no surprise people would claim the whole thing is hard and useless. Memorizing abstract rules and weird names is hard, and it feels pointless. Trying to shove real life situations in the middle of that framework is not going to help at all, and it doesn't.

The CORRECT approach should be from the perspective I call ""we need a thing, how do we do it?"". Now, mathematically oriented people will already be complaining to me that ""teaching kids formal proofs? are you nuts?!"" but I'm proposing nothing of the sort.

I think formality should come second to intuition. It's much easier to build formality on top of intuition than intuition on top of formality. Intuition is also more useful, especially in the long term: you may not remember how to compute the area of a circle, but if you remember you can cut a circle into several tiny triangles, you can quickly derive the area yourself.

So, for instance, instead of telling people a circle has 2&pi; radians, show them [why and how to build a radian, and show them how half a circle has around 3.141592... radians](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Circle_radians.gif), and how we can simply call this number &pi; to simplify things. Immediately, it follows that 2&pi; radians cover the whole circle, regardless of the size of the circle.

Want to explain why cos^2 x + sin^2 x = 1? Explain to them [what cosine and sine are in terms of the unit circle](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Circle_cos_sin.gif). They'll understand that cosine is the horizontal position of a point at x radians around the circle, and that sine is vertical. They can now immediately understand why sin(&pi;/2) = 1. If they understand this difference between sine and cosine they don't have to remember SOHCAHTOA because it's obvious from the construction.

The entirety of algebra is about creatively doing things to both sides of an equation, usually adding zero and multiplying by one in creative ways. This is ridiculously obvious: if two things are equal, doing the same thing to the two things shouldn't change anything! Nobody has a difficulty with this concept. Instead, people are taught to think of meaningless rules to move symbols around, and the underlying concept of algebra is lost.

Every single concept in math can be taught from this approach (and it is, but formally in higher education). It is not done this way because most of the times the teachers don't fully understand the concepts themselves, and also because the mathematical literature is ripe with regurgitation of old teaching techniques. (Which, I think, it's about time we get rid of and start from scratch with modern tools.)

And mathematicians and physicists are to blame as well. Things are often deliberately made more complicated than they are, almost as a way to show off how much smarter they are than the student who's trying to learn for the first time.

Teachers forget they once were students themselves, and the pitfalls and mistakes they've made. If teachers were a little more self-aware of this, math and physics education would improve tremendously.

(**EDIT**: This last point is what I try to keep at heart when I do my animations. When you finally understand a concept, when something finally clicks in your head, there's usually two responses: excitement, followed by anger. We always think ""Aaahhhhhh! Of course! This is so obvious now!"", and a second later, ""Why the HELL did nobody tell me that from the beginning?"" So I've been telling things how I wanted them to be told from the beginning.)

(**EDIT 2**: also, regarding ""real world applications""/""when will I ever use this?"", [see this other comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/3pu3o0/lucasvb_gives_his_answer_to_why_do_people_dislike/cw9ka27) I made over on /r/DepthHub)

----

So there's a huge amount of variables at play, and unfortunately, they are all in a feedback loop. It goes way beyond math too.

It will be hard to change things overnight, but one way to start is to sell people this simple idea: ***it is fun to figure things out***.

Mathematics is just a puzzle game. People enjoy puzzles and games, one way or the other (all areas of human knowledge are about piecing together a puzzle of some sort.)

They just haven't learned to see the puzzle in math, and they don't know how to play it. It's as if we're teaching people how to paint by showing them famous pictures, or how to compose music by having them listen to music.

If you realize this, it's no surprise people don't enjoy math: they were never taught or allowed to play the game.

[There's a famous text by Paul Lockhart](http://mysite.science.uottawa.ca/mnewman/LockhartsLament.pdf) about how the beauty and fun in math is lost to most people due to poor education. It's too poetical for me, and not exactly offering solutions, but it's well worth a read."
Has nonviolent protest lost its effectiveness in the US?,"Honestly, I think the idea that the US has a history of successful, completely non-violent protest is an idea manufactured and championed by the establishment. It's a convenient fantasy that encourages obedience, or at most *slightly inconvenient* disobedience.

[Al Jazeera](http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/11/26/american-social-movementshavealwaysincludedriots.html) covers it more eloquently than I ever could, but I'll toss in my additional/derived two cents anyway.

Many of the ""flashpoints"" in American human rights emerged in reaction to and coincident with violent protests, because that's when shit gets real. When people are being mildly inconvenienced, or when people are peacefully assembling, it's actually *very easy to ignore*.

We remember the era of MLK as an era of non-violent protest because that is the most convenient narrative for the establishment. It encourages very slow change with minimal disruption to the status quo.

But that's not the reality. Protests often turned ugly and violent, sometimes white ""counter-rioters"" would pop up and try to (or succeed in) razing black communities to the ground.

I think it's convenient to believe that the same progress would have been made even if the civil rights movement of the 50s/60s had been 100% non-violent. But I really think that, as ugly and horrible as violence is, it raises the stakes and accelerates things.

If a thousand protesters stand quietly in a candle vigil, then that's one thing.

If people's property and investments and companies start getting threatened because *that's how upset the disenfranchised are* then that changes the calculus. Maybe that's a cold, cynical way of looking at the world, but that's how I see it.

**EDIT:** [This comic](https://thenib.com/great-moments-in-peaceful-protest-history-44bdadb44cf) says the same thing I just did, but funnier."
"In this lockdown period, should the world now evaluate what jobs are really valuable for the society to function and set the compensations of those doing these jobs accordingly?","I mean the importance of every job is changing every time. Before the modernization, farmers were very important but now software engineers and computer technicians are important. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, health officials are the most important and they will remain important after the virus subsides for a long time.
The truth is, we are always evaluating what jobs are the most important so technically, we are already doing that."
How can society work around the problem of 'childcare workers deserve a respectable wage' vs 'childcare fees are prohibitively expensive'?,"
One issue that OP's question does not address is the fact that many families are forced to have both parents work due to the high cost of living, and salaries that have not met the rate of inflation for decades. Therefore these families must rely on childcare by default. 

Perhaps we should close tax loopholes and increase the tax rate on corporations such that the additional tax revenue could supplement the cost of childcare for single parent families and the like. Of course this solution doesn't directly address the issue of wage inequality, but it helps to an extent with wealth redistribution. 

I am simply trying to point out the irony behind major corporations being the greatest benefactors of both the highest degree of tax relief, as well as the largest recipients of welfare; in that their employees have to rely on entitlements because the company does not pay a living wage...AND both parents have to work while paying the high cost of childcare.

Can hookup culture exist in a meaningful and healthy way for women?,"Hey there,
I'm a 24 yo bi woman who's taken part in hookup culture, as well as polyamorous relationships and long term monogamous relationships.
Over the years I've spent a lot of time analyzing my relationship with sex and intimacy with the various long and short term partners I've had.
The conclusion I've come to, though I don't think casual sex is wrong in any way, I think there is something very intrinsically human that it doesn't satisfy.
I've consentually entered or even instigated casual hookups that I later felt badly about. It was always a strange feeling of having made myself vulnerable or open to someone who couldn't see me as a whole, complex, person. And how could they? They'd only known me for a few days, weeks, hours, and yet we'd done something so intimate that it causes a sort of dissonance. 
I think we all use sex to different ends, but to fulfill something that we feel is lacking in our lives rn - intimacy, safety, thrills, adrenaline, power, escape, self esteem etc. I think western culture has overplayed how important sex is in our lives, and leaves us with a feeling of fomo if we're not having a lot of it, or makes us think that sex can fix a lot more than it can.
My favorite poet, Maggie Nelson, has a great line about it in her book ""Bluets"" - ""fucking leaves everything as it is""
I've had short encounters that were really beautiful and taught me a lot about myself. But that's exactly it - it was about me, not them or ""us"".
I know my experience isn't reflective of everyone. It's just mine. What I've come to believe is that sex, in its nature, is the most physically intimate act two people can partake in. It can also be the most emotionally intimate, and (imo, though I've met a lot of people who disagree) it's unnatural to divorce those two aspects from each other. This doesn't mean that encounters can't be short, but I think it's the dissonance between the physical intimacy and lack of emotional intimacy that leaves a lot of people (not just women, but any people who are sensitive by nature) dissatisfied with hookup culture.

Why would so many powerful people be involved in pedophilia?,"Because *people* are involved in paedophilia.  

There's a few things at work, mind.  

There's almost certainly a shitton of dodgy shit under the surface of middle- and working-class western society as well.  Think about the stat that 1/4 adult women have been exposed to a situation resembling one of Weinsteins' abuses - but the Weinstein abuses are the ones dominating the papers.  Don't subscribe to this as an ""elites"" problem as opposed to a ""people"" problem.  

Content biasing in the media.  There's bigger spotlights on the 'elites', as well as a bigger market for exposes on them.  This results in huge apparent biasing towards what is and isn't reported; paedophilia doubles down on this because the victims are particularly 'newsworthy' and the crimes particularly lurid and shocking.  

Abusers are drawn to positions and environments where they can indulge their nature.  In the case of paedophilia - regular and/or unsupervised contact with young people, positions of trust and authority, and an enabling peripheral network.  Teachers, pastors ... entertainment industry, politics. 

And ... the more secure an abuser is in their position, they more bold their abuses will be.  Feeling like he was powerful enough in Hollywood to stay on top & stifle reporting likely contributed to Weinstein committing more assaults than were he a nobody middle-manager somewhere concerned about his abuses 'getting out'.  

AFIK paedophilia is best understood as a sex orientation, for all that it's a deviant and harmful one.  That means that power isn't going to turn someone normal into a paedo any more than exposure to the Mens Athletic Swim Club turns a straight bloke gay.  The only notable coda to this is that rape and sex abuses are often more about sociocultural/interpersonal 'power' and domination (as opposed to structural, like politics or wealth), in which case the victim selection is less about sex appeal and more about opportunity.  This means someone who is an opportunistic sex abuser but not necessarily ""a paedophile"" might attack a child or youth because they were vulnerable and accessible rather than because they were a kid.  (Weinstein and Woody Allen both reportedly forced themselves on minors, but for different if equivalently horrifying reasons.)"
"Given the recent shootings in Canada and Seattle what do you think about the quote from psychiatrist Dr. Frank Deitz ""every time we have intense media saturation of mass murder we expect to see one or two more within a week"". Does media really play as much of a role in these things as he believes?","It certainly doesn't help prevent anything. Some of these idiots are definitely doing it for ""the glory"", and the media does society no benefits by plastering their name and faces everywhere for a week. 

Best thing the media could do is to stop reporting any personal details on the shooter.  We don't need to know his name, or what he looks like, or what his personal struggles were all about. Instead focus on the victims, and celebrate their lives. "
"Why are Western Babyboomers so conservative, despite living through one of the most hedonistic decades of all time?","Assuming you are talking about the 60s, hippies were *not* the majority. That's just tv and movies making you think that. 

Aside from that, it's a general truism that people get more conservative as they age, raise a family, and have some money. 

Basically, the premise of your question is kind of off. "
"For those who are against testing products on animals--what is your alternative? To test them on humans? Or do you feel that things like chemotherapy, shampoo, and sunscreen should not be further developed?","Most of the commenters here seem to have no idea what they're talking about.  Medical research on animals like mice is required for us to develop new medicines effectively.  As you say, the alternative is essentially to just cease progress.  Anyone who doesn't yet understand this needs more information about the situation.

What I think is a problem regarding animal testing is more in the cosmetics industry.  Perhaps the stories are just exaggerated, but you hear tales of them applying 1000x normal concentration of a lip balm to a rabbit's eyeball for 8 hours or other such madness.  That, to me, seems cruel and unusual.  A balanced approach is needed which avoids testing random chemicals on sick children without being too extreme.

Additionally, the public placing blame on companies and institutions for their cruelty to animals is understandable, but misdirected.  From a corporate perspective, if they can legally perform the 8-hour-1000x-concentration-on-rabbit-eyeball test for no cost, and it reduces their chance of being targeted by a $100 million lawsuit, there's no question that they'll order the researchers to perform the test.

We can and should be angry at them for making that decision, but we cannot expect differently.  What we can and should expect is for government to step in and regulate what sorts of tests are ethically necessary, and what sorts of tests are banned for cruelty without sufficient benefit.  Government is where both the incentive and the capability exists to be able to hinder such cruelty, so that's where the focus of activists should be directed."
"If scientists discovered that a certain group of people were inherently more violent, less intelligent, or otherwise inferior to everyone else, would it be ethical to suppress that information in order to protect that group from being discriminated against?","I think its important to note that, either way, the entire group would not be less intelligent, more violent, etc. Only the *average* member of the group would be so, and only in comparison to other groups (obviously). What would occur would be an [overlapping distribution of two bell curves.](http://i.imgur.com/hf33f5h.gif) So widespread discrimination would still be unwarranted, because while, for instance, blue-eyed people *in general* might be less intelligent than green-eyed people *in general*, there is zero reason to expect that any *particular* blue-eyed person is less intelligent than any *particular* green-eyed person. That's how statistics work, yet that is lost on most people.

I think it would be ethical to suppress such information, but impractical. It would be much easier to let the information out there but to discredit it and malign the researchers who conducted the studies. If the difference was pronounced enough to be noticeable to even a layperson, then suppressing it would be impossible, and if the difference was smaller than that, discrediting the researchers would be much easier."

With each relationship, that giddness about ythe whole ""omg i have a girlfriend"" kinda dissipates and, in good relationships anyways, is replaced with a giddiness about the person, about their personalities, their actions, all that craic.

"Why do people NOT think of tyrants (Pharaohs, Nero, Gilgamesh) the same way they think of Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot?","No one even knows anyone, even in distant memory, who were personally affected by these people, and our substantial cultural apparatus for conveying this sort of information says basically nothing about them, so no childhood associations get formed. Instead you find out in a history text footnote when you're 19 that Gegis Khan killed a bunch of people a billion years ago, and that seems pretty bad, but there's no visceral or personal connection there. "
"Sex is natural and humans love it, how/why did it become the taboo that it is today?","Sex is controlled one way or another in the vast majority of social species.  Humans would be quite the exception if we didn't put any boundaries on it.  Many social species limit sex to one or a few individuals...from eusocial species like ants with one reproductive female, to herd species where the dominant male mates and excludes other males, who can reproduce with who is typically limited.  In species that form pairs, like many birds and some fish, either individual of the pair may cheat or attempt to cheat, and this often leads to conflict between, eg, resident male and interloper.  In some species, mating is promiscuous, which means that any individual in the group can mate with any other individual.  Among the great apes, gorillas follow the ""dominant male"" model while both chimps and bonobos are  promiscuous.

So in some sense, you'd expect ""taboo"" around sex because most group-dwelling animals have lots of social control around who mates with who, and attempting to mate in the wrong context can get you attacked.

To bring it back to people in particular, humans follow all sorts of patterns with regard to mating, but there tends to be quite a lot of social control built up around it one way or another.  Humans are a bit unusual among mammals in that males often commit a fair amount of resources to raising their offspring.  For them to do this, they need some assurance the offspring is theirs, and that means societal taboos to restrict sex between non-pair individuals.  From the woman's side, it can be advantageous to prevent one's mate from fathering children elsewhere who might divert resources away from your own offspring.   All these concerns get built up even more in the context of agricultural societies, where marriages are often used to cement alliances between groups.  If the marriage breaks down, it could impact much more than just two individuals.  

From a societal perspective,  there's further incentive to build social controls and taboos around sex.  Because humans pair bond so strongly, emotions run high in matters related to sex.  That can lead to a lot of conflict over who is sleeping with who, which can in turn lead to injuries, feuds, and deaths-especially in societies without legal systems or strong governments that quash that kind of vigilante action.  It's in everyone else's interest that members of society don't go getting in fights or killing each other, and by imposing order you can bring some control to the situation and reduce this issue.

How would you describe your country's sense of humor?,"Currently living in **Burkina Faso**, West Africa for over a year. Whenever you take a long transport on a bus (anything over 5 hours) you might be lucky enough to get a bus with a DVD player at the front. And what they show is the same ""Soap Opera"" story again and again from different ""studios"" which is this: A rich family with a nice house and several cars will have an unfaithful husband who is sleeping around with his secretary, which will lead to his wife confronting him and they will then scream at each other for like 7 minutes. Then the husband will beat his wife and children. It is all very loud and obnoxious to me as an American, but the Burkinabè will lose it with laughter watching it. Bonus if the episode included a miracle performed by the glory of Jesus and an African Witch Doctor who renounces black magic by the end. 

In village, the humor is very different than Americans. To me, many people will just bluntly ask for my things, or tell me I must buy them some things at the market, but this is banter and they don't actually expect me to do this for them. Many of the jokes here are just stories of how a crazy person was acting crazy."
What is the problem with cultural appropriation?,"I don’t think it’s inherently a bad thing, but it’s good to talk about it so that we have the language to criticize those instances where it can be. A lot of Buddhist iconography, for example, is often appropriated for marketing (think just about any brand with “Zen” in the title), proliferating a lot of misunderstandings about Buddhism in the West. These misunderstandings can manifest as little errors, like using Nirvana and Heaven interchangeably, but it can maybe lead to others as well - Myanmar’s human rights abuses against the Rohingya have actually been documented for years, but I think they only became front-page news to western audience very recently because for a while we assumed Buddhist populations must all have the sort of calm, peaceful outlook that our marketed fantasy of them has made. On a less directly harmful level, I think there’s some understandable resentment by once-foreign minority groups in the West when some part of their culture that’s very important or even sacred to them becomes a passing fad for the population as a whole with little to no respect for that sanctity.

"If the USA were to balkanize, what independent countries do you think would emerge, what would they look like, and which would be most successful?","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megaregions_of_the_United_States might be a good place to look for this question; the megaregions are defined by linked economies and cultures, and it seems likely that the balkanized US would keep those intact. It's also not a huge stretch of the imagination to assume that the US would split along state borders. That would give the following map, with dark gray being Canada and light gray being undecided: http://imgur.com/6Nm3O2u

As has been previously mentioned in this thread, it's also likely that sans the US, Quebec would secede. It also seems that the Maritime provinces wouldn't be thrilled with that idea, and so would either remain a part of Canada (dubious due to the large, hostile power now dividing them from mainland Canada), or would petition to be a part of the Bo-Wash region. Assuming that the latter happened, Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont would also almost certainly join this country as well: http://imgur.com/KZ6MBjB

On the topic of Canada, quite a few people in this thread seem to be of the opinion that BC would join Cascadia. I don't know much about the politics of that region, so I'll assume they know what's up. It also seems unlikely to me that Alaska would remain a sovereign state, so that'll go to Canada: http://imgur.com/4cxyMt4

Cincinnati is right on the Kentucky border, so I'll pretend that that economic factor is important enough to swing Kentucky into the Mid-West region. To the south of Virginia and to the East of Texas I recreated a Dixie-like state, on cultural grounds. I took Louisiana out of the Texas region and put it into Dixie also on Cultural Grounds, and on the assumption that New Orleans is the only city in that region economically significant enough to serve as a capital. New Mexico and Colorado I had fuse with Texas: http://imgur.com/9amsB0m

This leaves a region of 13 states which I know little to nothing about, and which I don't /believe/ have strong enough economies to be completely autonomous. So:
- Alamo takes the remaining two four-corners states.
- California takes Nevada
- Idaho goes to Cascadia
- The remaining states become part of Minnesota

Voila: http://imgur.com/O7F45dG


And I'm no expert on economies or trade relations or anything of the sort, so this division would be most interesting to me on a political level. The US is already being driven further and further to extremes, and these splits would make it so those divergences could happen. Cascadia, California, and the Atlantic Corridor would take strides and leaps towards isolationist liberalism, whereas Alamo and Dixie would grow more and more conservative. The only countries that would be as split as the US is today are Minnesota, the Midwest, and Florida.

Most countries would stay in a democratic republic, although a few may switch over from the representative system to a parliamentary one (especially in countries where people aren't incredibly bound to where they're from. i.e. more likely in the Midwest than the Atlantic Corridor). The only country which might switch away from democracy (and this is still highly unlikely) is Minnesota; there's currently a seccesionist movement in that region which aims to create a socialist republic. Fascinating if it would happen, but I'm not betting on it.

Annnnnnnnd I should probably get back to work.

tl;dr: http://imgur.com/O7F45dG. Also, politics are fascinating.

I'm not sure whether or not to make another map yet, as by far the biggest complaint with my process was my decision that states would stick together, and while in retrospect that may have been an erroneous decision, it also made making maps a heckton easier.

"Where do you draw the line between ""stop worrying about what other people think of you"" and ""learn to accept criticism and improve yourself""? I","There is a difference between valid feedback and people being judgmental.  

Feedback can be critical, but it should help you to understand someone's perspective about you and allow you to see how you affect them.  Or, it could just be someone expressing an opinion about you that you can choose to take on board or you can ignore it.  Most people are able to recognize their faults and receiving feedback can help you to improve yourself.  

That kind of information can help you grow as a person.  

But if someone is just being judgmental, their input is not likely to help you, so you should ignore it.  That's where I imagine the ""don't care what other people think"" mantra comes from."
Why do most nation’s have a negative opinion of Israel?,"To preface this, the Arab-Israeli conflict is the most complicated political issue in the world. It's been the most complicated political issue in the world since the breakup of the Soviet Union. You will find that a reasonably complete answer to your question will not fit into a few paragraphs. Maybe you'll get a reasonably complete answer in a textbook, but I'm not going to write a textbook for you. (ed: jk)

In the beginning, there was the Kingdom of Judah. We're talking 1000BC-500BC here. Long ass time ago. Anyway, it was ruled by Jews, supposedly beginning with David. It's what one would read about in the Old Testament if one is into that sort of thing. I won't get into it, but the short version of what the Torah will have you believe is that God gives Jews the Holy Land.

Then the Kingdom of Judah gets conquered by the Persians, and then by the Romans. All the stuff one might read about in the New Testament happens in the Roman Empire during this time. The Romans called this chunk of land Palestine. The short version is that Jesus, king of the Jews, does a bunch of stuff in Jerusalem and now Jerusalem is both the holy land of both the Jews and the Christians.

A few hundred years go by, the Roman Empire breaks up and now the Byzantine Empire aka the Eastern Roman Empire aka the Roman Empire (which is what they called themselves more or less, they viewed the breakup of the empire as being a minor territorial dispute) now rules over areas including Jerusalem oh and BTW they're Christian now instead of Roman Mythology, which is too bad because those stories are way more interesting than the holy books of the Abrahamic religions.

Yes, it's important that I give a rundown of most of western history. I told you it's complicated. Does this break rule 4 for commenting? Maybe? Certainly your question can't be answered without giving the background.

Anyway, Mohammad takes over the Arabian penninsula in the 7th century. (not Jerusalem though) During his life, he experiences a one night journey where he visits ""the farthest mosque"". (I'm paraphrasing here, and Muslims aren't supposed to paraphrase Mohammad, but I'm not Muslim so I don't care. Google ""isra miraj"".) Islamic scholars are in broad agreement that ""the farthest mosque"" is Jerusalem, even if such agreement is on somewhat shaky theological foundations. Most notably, there weren't any Muslims in Jerusalem, let alone Mohammad, so there's that. But it doesn't matter; now Jerusalem is Islam's holy land too.

After Mohammad died, the government he created didn't die with him. Nor the religion of course. At this point, the government and the religion is kind of the same thing, and takes over a lot of land. Including Jerusalem. A few hundred years later, the Pope decides This Will Not Stand, and begins the Crusades. The Crusades are their own complicated topic, but all you need to know is that from the Islamic perspective, were Peak Catholic Assholery. Although there were a few individuals who really cared about recapturing the holy land, but mostly it was about looting and pillaging. They sacked, looted, and pillaged Constantinople, which was Catholic at that point. It was a shitshow, you didn't want to live in Constantinople at that point. They also looted and pillaged everything else they came across too, but the point is, they sacked, looted, and pillaged Constantinople, which was the (Catholic) Byzantine Empire's capital.

...which left the Byzantine Empire open to being conquered by the Muslims. Which it was. Despite the fact that the crusaders basically gave the Muslims Constantinople and the rest of modern day Turkey, they were still really salty about getting looted, raped, and pillaged for 200 odd years.

This was pretty much the status quo for several hundred years with regards to Jerusalem. The Ottoman Empire took over, and there were squabbles about land in other places, notably Spain and Eastern Europe, but all was pretty quiet in Jerusalem. The Ottoman Empire had plenty of border squabbles, but for the most part, they were pretty good about letting local ethnic communities take care of their own shit. If there were towns, villages, or communities within larger cities of Jews or Christians or Coptics or whatever living wherever, even in Jerusalem, and they kept order and paid their taxes, the Ottomans left them alone.

Meanwhile, the Jews were having a pretty shitty time in the West, including Europe and Russia. (I'm finally starting to get to the point) Think Jim Crow but different. Systematic, institutionalized prejudice prevented them from owning land or voting etc. A lot of Jews were talking about making their own nation-state comprised entirely of Jews. Not a whole lot of traction was gained though; things were bad, but they weren't *that* bad. Still, the voices were loud. This philosophy was (and still is) called Zionism -- the establishment of a nation-state of Jews, ideally located in the Jewish holy land, Israel. (which hadn't been a thing for 2000 years)

WWI happens. The Ottoman Empire sides with the Central Powers. (aka the losing side) The Ottoman Empire is overrun during the course of the war, the country is broken up and parceled out. (go watch Lawrence of Arabia) Jerusalem becomes part of the British Empire. Some Muslims view this as a continuation of the Crusades. The rest of the Central Powers are instituted with limp-dick governments and a mandate to repay tremendous sums of money to the victors.

Germany ends up an economic shitshow. Hyperinflation happens, basically everything turns to shit. Adolf Hitler rose to power, blames the Jews, pograms and stuff happens. WWII happens, the Holocaust, etc. Hitler is eventually defeated.

The US is still fighting Japan for another year, France becomes a country again and is dealing with their own problems, and Britain and Russia are mostly cleaning up Hitler's mess. The Jews, for the most part, are like fuck this shit I'm out. But where do you go? Well, they've been hearing crazy Uncle Avi rant about wanting to move to Israel for about five decades. And they want to go fucking *anywhere*, and guess what, Britain is like, ""fine, you can go to Israel"" since they owned it, and didn't want to be accused of mistreating Jews in the aftermath of the Holocaust. So lots of Jews move to Israel.

Here's the thing about the Jews going to Israel: it isn't just a migration, it's a cultural movement. Hebrew, a dead language for 2000 years, is resurrected, and becomes an unofficial language. The Jews form their own government system, with de facto local leaders, (although no official authority or sovereignty) and petition the British government to become their own countries. Their Arab neighbors, with their own de facto leaders without official authority view this as kind of a joke, because they've been making the same arguments, even to the point of armed insurrection, since the breakup of the Ottoman Empire, which again, they view as a continuation of the crusades, with Christians coming in and looting and pillaging. Britain can't deal with trying to put down a Jewish rebellion, both because of the PR thing (what with the Holocaust and all that) and because they have to rebuild their own country and because the Korean War is happening. Britain's internal politics are a shitshow, and Britain's superpower status is wavering. Hard.

So Britain gives the Israeli authorities sovereignty. And the Arab authorities lose their shit. Civil war starts. The short version is that Israel wins, and effectively controls most of the land. So now it's 1950 and Israel has become its own real country effectively out of nowhere in about three years. There are a handful of Arabs who live there, but for the most part, they're outnumbered in Israel by a significant margin, and the displaced people in the refugee camps never really had any real assets to begin with. Israel has an open immigration policy for Jews, and they experience significant immigration over the coming decades.

In 1956, Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal. (google Suez Crisis) This angered Britain and France. Britain and France talk Israel into invading Egypt, in exchange for aid. From a military standpoint, this succeeds, but it's a political shitshow. There's widespread outrage in the British public for starting another fucking war, the US is pissed because it jeopardized anti-communist agendas in other places, (Egypt was ostensibly a relatively friendly state to the US) basically it goes poorly. Britain is oil-strapped because of the loss of the Suez Canal, Britain goes to the IMF for help, the US shuts them down, Saudi Arabia embargoes Britain for oil, and the US supports them. Britain, France, and Israel pull out. But the damage is already done. Israel isn't just a stain on the map, Israel is now actively a threat to the sovereignty of Egypt, in their mind.

Tensions are high. Israel is in a bad economic and political position, they don't have aid from anyone, they can't buy weapons from any country except France, and France has shitty weapons. The remaining Arabs in Israeli controlled lands aren't doing so well, they can't go to other Arab countries because those countries aren't accepting refugees, it's a shitshow. Meanwhile, Israel is building settlements in lands inhabited by Arabs for the massive influx of Jews who want their own Jewish homeland."
"84 planes have vanished since 1948, 11 in the past 10 years alone. Why is MH370 receiving a disproportionate amount of publicity?","Seems pretty obvious to me and don't see any link with American passengers. In the UK it's had pretty wide coverage but barely any focus on the nationality of the passengers other than the Chinese, primarily because china was kicking up such a fuss.

I see the reasons as:

1) This is the first time a plane has gone missing with so many people on board. If you look at all previous missing plane examples, the highest number of missing passengers has been well short of the MH370 roster.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_aerial_disappearances

Of course if MH370 is found, it'll be removed from this list.

2) We're in an era of mass instant media. A plane going missing 20 years ago wouldn't have received nearly as much instant and persistent global attention.

3) The circumstances have been so utterly unique to any other missing aircraft case or indeed any crashed and discovered aircraft. At the start it seemed like daily events would contradict the previous day's news. This alone simply kept it in the news, because each day brought new news.

Nothing really more to add.

Edit: Actually I would like to add another point....

4) Slow news month. Other than Russia land grabbing the Crimea, there's not really been a huge amount of global news this past month. I think this disappearance suited the new outlets as the Crimea, from a news standpoint, was stagnating."
(Sandy Hook)Why aren't we talking about the mental health of our teenagers as opposed to banning 30 round clips?,"Because we like quick, definite solutions to problems.  Mental health is poorly understood, and treatment of it is imprecise and arduous at best.  But if we can determine an object is the root of this problem, we can easily ban that and then solve the problem, right?

Furthermore, our lawmakers have extremely little knowledge or understanding of the various health fields, most are lawyers and such, so they understand the bureaucratic and economic effects of things and how they play into the lawmaking system, but are in the dark about how to address other issues in the ways that are familiar to them."
We live in a time when an unprecedented amount of people can spread misinformation (knowingly and unknowingly). What does the future look like with such circumstances? Is there hope of this ever changing or is this just something that has/will always exist?,"Misinformation and propaganda are nothing new, but the internet - and particularly social media - has changed the game. That genie isn’t going back into the bottle, unless there are enormous changes to the way we (are allowed to) use these tools.

The only solution I see, short of laws being enacted (which would be a wasp nest of free speech issues), is a major effort to educate the public about critically evaluating news and information, drawing from multiple reputable sources, and evaluating arguments with logical rigor.

But, at least in the United States, the very people in charge of making this kind of educational push feasible are arguably those people who benefit most from having an uninformed, gullible public. Not to put too fine a point on it, shit’s bleak."
How will the world be different post coronavirus?,"I can say confidently that:  

* There will be many closed businesses and it will take a while for the economy to recover. 
* Many jobs will be changed entirely or mostly to work from home. Many more will retain at least partial work from home structure. It's a hell of a lot harder for a boss to say it's not possible for a couple days when it's been done for months.
* Social contact is likely to be much reduced for a long time. Fewer handshakes, hugs, or kisses on the cheek in greeting.

I hope, but am not at all confident that: 

* ~~Wet~~ markets will be shut down Edit: Live wild animal markets to be more specific, thanks /u/Awarth_ACRNM 
* Essential workers will be able to get the minimum wage raised to be paid a living wage for their, as we have discovered, truly essential work. 
* Public perception of workers in jobs that are not glamorous will remain raised after the pandemic ends. 
* Healthcare will be uncoupled from work. The huge unemployment coupled with coronavirus pandemic quickly showed that in the interest of public health, we need people to have healthcare available to them whether they are working or not. 

I expect, but hope we can avoid:

* Consolidation of businesses. I expect these large businesses that can weather the downturn or have enough influence to get a government bailout will buy out or simply take the place of smaller businesses that were unable to survive. I would expect more oligopolies taking advantage of customers in the next decade 
* The rich get richer. The wealthy will have plenty to buy up devalued assets just like they did with the '08 crash. Wealth inequality will get a huge boost.
* Many people laid off during the pandemic will not get jobs back or their jobs will have a pay cut. Companies that lay off thousands will discover that they can pay people less to work from home or that they only need hundreds to do what they previously needed thousands for thanks to technology that was available, but not implemented before the pandemic forced it."
Why don't novelists ever rewrite other novels in the same way that musicians cover songs or film-makers remake films?,"People reimagine familiar stories all of the time. At least the early Harry Potter books are full of old fantasy tropes. This isn't even a shot at J.K Rowling, because it's pretty standard for fantasy and sci-fi to borrow from previous work. The number of fantasy worlds with human sized elves (using that spelling), halflings and dwarves speaks to that. 

Another example; My wife started reading ""1984"" after reading ""The Hunger Games,"" and was shocked at the number of things Hunger Games that are basically lifted straight from the earlier work. They would be familiar to anyone who has seen or read any kind of dystopia fiction.

I think what Shakespeare did was really closer to making a movie adaptation of a book. He took existing stories and put them on stage with his own flavor.

Copyright is a big reason why a random writer can't put out the exact same book, and many authors walk a very fine line when it comes to ripping off more recent work (including Rawling, who faced some plagarism criticisms and lawsuits). 

As someone else said, film is based on the visual. Look at Baz Luhrman's ""Romeo & Juliet"" - he didn't re-write the words at all, he just made it look cool and added some music. It was purely what it looked like that made it different. Then there's foreign film remakes because non-English foreign films don't draw a big audience in the U.S. Direct re-makes don't happen that often; the last one I can think of is ""Psycho,"" and that isn't terribly well regarded.

Re-writing a book just doesn't make sense. The closest thing may be updating the language of an older story, which has been done with ancient works, but why would you read a re-written copy of a book that already exists?"
Why is it that people must go through years of paperwork to adopt a child but go through none to have one?,"A child up for adoption is ridiculously vulnerable and hence protected by regulation. But you can't stop people popping 'em out for themselves. 

Once they're born though, there's more legal protection for those same reasons of vulnerability - you can have a kid without any hassle, but if you mistreat them you don't get to keep them (in an ideal world)."
"Why did the phenomenon of the ""World's Fair"" disappear? Should the idea be reintroduced? What would a World's Fair for 2020 even look like?","It doesn't seem like they ever went away. According to Wikipedia, [they're still happening today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World%27s_fair). The most recent one was in Kazakhstan in 2017."
"You're in a driverless car about to enter a tunnel. A child runs into the street right before. Should your car kill the child or swerve to avoid the danger, killing you in the process?","Because the car cannot be constantly making value decisions of victim(s) vs victim(s) as it drives, watching pedestrians and bicyclists and trying to evaluate the demographics of those people (and which are more valuable than others?), the answer, to me, seems both simple and cruel: the car should kill the child.

As both /u/RoboChrist and /u/EnuffDakka have said, the car should make every effort, up to endangering its passenger(s), to protect other people such as pedestrians. However, if there were a car that placed others' safety above the safety of the passenger(s), that car would quickly fall of the market, and also be a greater hazard. Consider also that in any vehicle/pedestrian accident, the likelihood of death or injury is vastly greater for the pedestrian; putting the vehicle passenger at risk for the mere possibility that the pedestrian might live *instead* is not a chance to take with any life."
Gun People of Reddit: What's your view of the end game?,"We are at the end game, at least for now. What I mean by that is freedoms vs cost is always going to rebalance itself over time as attitudes change. I think that the cost/benefits of gun ownership is pretty much stuck politically and will remain so for the next decade at least. 
I'm not skilled at posting sources on Reddit especially with my mobile, but I will try. Violence in the US has declined significantly over the last 30-40 years. amp/www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/01/30/5-facts-about-crime-in-the-u-s/%3famp=1
Gun ownership over that same period hasn't changed. 
https://www.statista.com/statistics/249740/percentage-of-households-in-the-united-states-owning-a-firearm/
School shootings have not changed significantly in recent years either. 
https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/349380002
What has changed is the coverage and subsequently the perception of school shooting frequency and the danger of gun ownership. I don't think arming staff is a rational response, I don't think hardening schools beyond what is already common is needed, I don't think yelling mental health is the answer. It sounds harsh, so it is hard for politicians to say, but school shootings, while admittedly a largely uniquely American problem, actually aren't much of a problem. To remove or significantly limit gun ownership over school shootings is like removing cars because you ran over the mailbox instead of because people die in traffic accidents. There are arguments against guns, but school shootings are a statistically very weak one. I think any real conversation has to start with an agreement on what the problem actually is. I don't think there is anything close to an agreement on that. "
"Why does society so often define ""success"" or ""being successful"" as ones ability to accumulate lots of money?","Money gives you the ability to control the world around you, all the way from where you get to be, what items you have, what food you eat, and even what your community will be like (as you can easily influence business and politics).

It's easy to argue its immoral aspects, but for many, control over their own lives is the greatest success."
If this wasn't a pandemic but a global social experiment - what have we learnt about ourselves as individuals and about us as a species?,"As a species:

Information should be shared truthfully, even if it damages you because in the end a lie can be far more devastating in a globally connected society.

As individuals:

The time we work per day is too much, we can be as productive in a smaller time period and from home--->happiness makes more productive.

 Our jobs should be here as entertainment in a senseless world. We need work for self-worth, but not to ""just"" survive. Happiness isn't found in doing a lot of work but rather in doing what you want and in the modern era that's actually a glimpse of hope that in the near future a big part of the population can ""self-fulfill"". We realise, I realised, that I need work. But not to survive, but to live life to its fullest.

"Is the phenomena of children loving to build forts an international and cross-cultural one? If so, why?","You might want to look up Dr. David Sobel's work.  As I recall, he found the activity cross cultural, and came up with an explanation, or maybe two, but I can't remember anymore what it was."
"We saw the end of pirates in the Golden Age of Piracy, the outlaws in the Wild West, and the mafia during the prohibition years - what types of criminals are going to see the end of their era in our time?",Arguably we witnessed the end of the golden age of hackers recently. The lenient sentencing that was common in the 90's that was practised in exchange for an exchange of technical expertise with the state could be compared with the 'letter of marque' which was given to privateers as a form of state sanctioned piracy. Now it's more common to see harsh sentences being given out because hacking has become an in-house practise rather than an outsourced one.
"Are evil people with great power corrupted because of their power, or were they always bad but just unable to show their true colors without power and money?","The way it looks to me is that people can’t become corrupt without power, because corruption comes from trying to hold in to power. It’s what happens when people refuse to give up their perceived influence on society, so they fight to maintain it which mutates and corrupts that influence."
"My mother works with a high school student who has been blind since birth. He comes from a really bad home, but he loves computers, enjoys reading, and is very intelligent. What sort of opportunities exist for people like him?","I am the mother of a blind person and I also work for a blind advocacy organization. There are tons of opportunities for the blind. I know blind people who work in every imaginable field. I would suggest that he attend a training center as soon as he graduates from high school to learn skills that are sadly not usually taught in the public school setting. For example, one program that I recommend highly works with young blind people to become entirely independent over the course of about a year. You get mobility and travel training, advocacy skills training, life skills, braille. The programs are designed to fit the individual need of the person. I would also advise that your mom help to put him in touch with independent successful blind mentors.

Has anyone ever lived as a closet straight man or woman? As in pretended to be homosexual for whatever reason.,"David Bowie during his Ziggy Stardust phase (1972) came out to the press as gay, then in 1983 he told Rolling Stone that he was always a closeted heterosexual.  He was very much straight through this period as  a great deal of women in the UK and US can attest to.

I guess the rational was to increase the intrigue of the Ziggy Stardust character he created.

What would the effect of total drug legalization be?,"As a recovering addict with over two years clean and as a felon convicted of dealing MJ, I think I'm well qualified to answer this question. 

First, there are millions of felons in the USA and most are non violent offenders like myself. Legalizing drugs would greatly reduce the stigma associated with past drug dealing / drug convictions. Many felons cannot find decent work or housing because of their records. This causes many of them to ""get back in the game"" so to speak and commit further crimes. It causes others to break down and end up in mental wards. More become homeless. This is highly detrimental, both to the felon himself and the community at large. If drugs were legalized, within a decade, or less, past drug convictions would have little effect on one's search for work or housing. Following legalization, more bills would likely be passed erasing / expunging the criminal records of non violent drug offenders. This would benefit society as a whole, allowing many hundreds of thousands to find jobs and pay taxes and reform themselves and better their own lives and their family's lives and their community as well. There are geniuses out there that can't contribute to society because they made a mistake and got themselves addicted to one drug or another and then committed a crime to support that addiction. This makes little sense. 

But it's not that easy. If drugs were legalized, a lot of people in recovery would use again / relapse. A lot of young people in their twenties would have easy access to opiates - the wort drug IMO -  physically addictive and utterly enslaving, and they would lose years of their lives like i did, and they would be destroyed financially, the would lose their friends and ultimately their families, and their potential recovery would be that much more difficult because they wouldn't have to drive to the awful neighborhoods to score, they could just go to Walmart. Obviously others would find other terrible substances like meth or coke or benzos. Just look at all the alcoholics out there. We all know some. Being an alcoholic may be less stigmatized than being a heroin addict, but alcohol kills much quicker than opiates. 

Ultimately, legalizing all drugs would be good for a number of entities - the government (taxes, reduced enforcement and prison costs, less powerful cartels) - corporations (manufacturing and selling the drugs) - and the public at large (less petty crime from addicts trying to support their habit and less violent crime associated with drug trafficking). But it would be negative for the people using the hard stuff. There is only darkness ahead for them regardless of the legality. The inevitable price drop would only get people more addicted than when they were paying 100$ a day on their habit and would subsequently cause more overdoses. 

My final word on the manner - legalize marijuana completely. Allow hallucinogenics like LSD, mushrooms, and DMT to be purchased from behind the counter at pharmacies if the person is approved to take them by a doctor (not a prescription, a statement of mental competency). Keep opiates and amphetamines and benzos prescription only, and allow MDMA to be prescribed as well. Decriminalize small, personal use amounts of all the hard drugs (heroin, cocaine, meth, etc.) there is no reason to throw a drug addict in jail. Provide treatment instead. "
Is 2020 going to be marked in the history books as the end of the golden age of the west?,"[Ray Dalio has published an analysis of the major empires and world powers for the past 500 years.](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/big-cycles-over-last-500-years-ray-dalio/)  It's interesting reading, and I'm not an economist or history buff but a lot of his arguments make sense to me.  He covers the Spanish briefly as a lead-in to the Dutch, British, US, and now Chinese ""empires""."
"[x-post from askreddit] After hearing about the drone strike which has killed 15 innocent people, I'm so done being quiet about my government. What's the most effective way to gather people together in a protest? This has gotten out of hand.","I would honestly suggest learning more, which might or might not change your views.  Vagueries like ""a small stance on green energy... like oil has been funded"" or ""an incredibly amount of debt"" don't do anyone any good.  Those are protest signs, not actionable items.  What exactly about energy policy do you want to change?  Which green energy source do you want to fund and where should the money come from?  How should the money be allocated, direct research, subsidies, contracts?  What Oil funding do you want to pull?


How much debt are we really in relative to growth rates and GDP?  Where does that place us relative to other nations?  How to we decrease the debt?  How quickly do we do it etc?



My point is that vague frustrations won't come to anything.  Learn the issues in depth and get behind a serious plan.  Expressing frustration has diminishing returns.  Instead of being anti-current policy, become pro-some new policy."
"TEACHERS who have taught in multiple cultures, how do the students behavior compare?","Before I start writing a bunch, just know that this answer is purely anecdotal from my personal experience teaching in a few different areas. I taught for about a year in America, three in South Korea, and one in Spain. The experiences were, of course, much different from each other, but the conclusions I've come to for 'why' surprised me when I took my preconceived notions of some of these cultural stereotypes and challenged them with real life experience.

Your question specifically mentions the Asian student stereotype. I'd say from my experience that, yes, my Asian students were much more disciplined and respectful in the classroom. This is due to a variety of factors. The buzzword is CULTURE, but that can even be broken down more.
Within Asian (specifically in this case, Korean) culture, status and age plays a big role not just in treatment of people around you, but also the language you use to communicate with those people. I'm sure you've heard of honorifics and politeness within these cultures, but I find that not many people I talk to understand HOW ingrained this is in the culture and specifically LANGUAGE. The words are different when you speak up or down to someone, not simply the way in which you say them. In other words, it's a lot more like actual word conjugation than tone change.
 If you ever find yourself in Asia, notice that people will ask you about your age A LOT. It's not because they're personally curious, but it's just something you have to know in order to communicate properly.

Ok sorry, I digress: In this way, the students know that they are students and the teachers know that they are teachers and there is a respect for authority that gets challenged a lot in a western classroom. There, if a kid is disrespectful in class, he/she is sent out and loses the learning opportunities for that time period. If this happens a lot, learning suffers,. Not to mention backlash from parents, administration, etc. In America it's about punishing the student in order to dissuade them from committing the disruption again; in Korea, the simple denial of education (more on this topic in the next paragraph) is a the punishment in itself and people WILL shape up, or fail. 


Another factor I'd like to suggest is the pressure and social impact of school life. In Korea, at least, you prepare your whole life for a test (수능) that people compare to a SAT or ACT. But it's much, much more than that. I'd say that I cared about the ACT for about 1.5 years leading up to it in High School. In Korea, if you don't get into a good elementary school in order to get to a good middle school, in order to get to a good high school to prepare you for the test, it's a really big deal. It ALL leads there. And if you don't do well... I believe that these days you get one more chance (I'm not sure about the retake aspect) but it is a shame issue, and your university and job prospects all hinge on your performance in this test.

Now, in America, we have socially changed the game as far as equal opportunity and second (and third and fourth...) chances to perform. Think about test retakes, special test-taking accommodations, etc. You can take the ACT as many times as you want and just go with the score you like best. Or, many universities don't care about your score anyway (etc.) so just show them your other attributes that make you a good university candidate. These sorts of opportunities DO NOT EXIST (as far as I've seen) in Korea. You perform on the test or you do not, and that's the end of that.
In a similar vein of educational opportunity: kids know from a young age that they will not be specially helped if they fall behind so it is their responsibility to keep up. To westerners this might have two responses. One being: but what if there are factors outside their control, they deserve to be properly educated!! Two being: Good, they have to be motivated to work and they'll sink or swim, and that's how it should be.
I had students in third grade, the age that formal English education starts in public school, who were already far enough behind that they gave up because nobody was coming back for them-- they didn't build a foundation so they were lost. 

All this to say that I believe the answer to your question is that in Asia, things are higher stakes because there is less accommodation for anything other than the best. If you fall behind, you stay behind literally for the rest of your life. And it's a rut that's hard to get out of. OP, you asked about things like teacher quality, and parents: They are strict and relentless, but it's not unusual in this situation. Imagine being a parent in this culture where if you watch your child fall behind, they literally lose opportunities that will shape the rest of their lives. When you realize this, you can begin to understand their attitudes and strictness for their children.


And a brief note if you're curious: I found Spain's educational climate to be much more similar to America's, although I was teaching in a very gifted bilingual public school with very motivated and skilled students, so it's hard to compare. However I will say that though the students there had less 'respect for authority' than I saw in Korea, it is America where the students really push teachers' buttons and test the boundaries of what is and is not allowed. It would be irresponsible to lay all the blame here, but I do think that in our society -right now- we have a lot of unaccountability within our popular culture and media; a lot of action without consequence. And maybe it seems too direct to link those topics together, but I'd say they are inextricably linked. Other places I've been teaching, consequence is swift and brutal. Here, chances are handed out willy-nilly, and punishments are either way too harsh for their crime or simply a handslap. 



If you have any other specific questions, I'm happy to chat. Once again, keep in mind that these are my personal experiences and opinions about the questions you asked, and this question is something that could, with anecdotal answers like mine, have wildly different outcomes."
"Are there things banned from American internet, like how we hear about things getting banned in China?","A lot of people have mentioned child pornography, but also, copyrighted material is one of the closest items to actually being 'scrubbed'.  You may have seen websites that were actually taken over by United States government agencies such as the FBI.  Also, DMCA take-down requests are send to providers such as YouTube and Google to both remove copyrighted material as well as remove searches that can link to copyrighted material."
What if Mitt Romney was president right now and Snowden gave up the NSA,"I think this is one of the areas where Obama and Romney wouldn't differ too much. Obama might be more willing to pursue changes to the system compared to Romney, but both are proponents of a strong Executive. But at the end of the day the general political consensus across both parties seems to be one that is largely content with the status quo. And there isn't much Obama could've done and didn't in regards to Snowden. Short of sending in Spec Ops into Hong Kong or Moscow, you couldn't really handle Snowden any differently. Romney might've been quicker and more vocal in condemning Snowden, but both Presidencies have a portion of their base that would make a hard and fast condemnation politically risky. "
"Realistically, will the Panama/Paradise Papers actually lead to meaningful political change?","No. These days political change comes at the cost of money. Those named in the papers have a fuck ton of money to ensure nothing happens. And guess what, nothing happened and it barely got any press. Because those who control the press are the same people caught."
"Would you prefer monarchy over an uneducated, willfully ignorant democracy?","As long as our rulers are smart and benevolent it doesn't matter which style of government we have. 

The problem is that power corrupts people and democracy gives us a peaceful way to replace our rulers. In a monarchy/dictatorship the only method to replace our rulers is through revolution. "
"Is it the goal of humanity to ultimately be surpassed by artificial intelligence? In other words, if AI eventually become superior to humans from a functional standpoint, should we accept that AI are better than human beings and accept them taking over as the superior lifeform?","I have two competing impulses here. On the one hand I think there's something kind of beautiful in imagining humanity as the scaffolding for something even more incredible, to think that nature has such an upward direction. I also harbor hope that if we created true AI they would not be malevolent, as I don't see any reason for them to be. On the contrary it seems to me likely that they would take care of us, even as an afterthought. I read somewhere once the observation that fish didn't get on land by inventing reverse-diving gear, they got onto land by evolving into something else. And then, lo and behond, given enough time their ancestors came back and made habitats for them on land. Similarly, it looks like it'll be impossible for humanity as it is to ever really spread through the stars. But perhaps our AI children may be able to work the superscience to create giant ark ships, or even dimensional gateways or something who knows, to spread humanity to new worlds, the same way we spread fish in our fish bowls. Perhaps simply because it will amuse them to have us around. And when that day comes the human race will basically be retired. Which brings it's own existential questions.

My competing impulse is that this is a terrible vision of the future, not to mention incredibly unlikely. More likely is that there is no true upward arrow of nature and we're simply a strange quirk of nature quickly proving itself unfit for longevity, wrecking the ecosystem that created us, and this kind of technofuturist daydreaming only serves to make us acquiese to those impulses. No need to worry about the future when daddy AI will come and set everything right. In this mood I feel we need to drastically reshape our priorities as a species. To focus on sustainability and happiness instead of constant growth. To realize that we're pretty close already to the point where our species could retire. If only we would work towards it directly. "
Would it be possible to elevate every country on earth to 1st world status? Or does the existence of 1st world countries mean that there has to be 2nd and 3rd world countries as well?,"As others have noted, ""first/second/third"" world actually mean ""america+allies, communists, and unaffiliated"" respectively, but obviously first and third have persisted in modern usage as approximately meaning ""rich and poor"" or ""more developed and less developed"". 

*You know what OP means, calling him on semantics isn't useful*

So, the actual question: ""Is it possible for every country to enjoy an average standard of living comparable with that of the US or western Europe?""

I think the answer may be no simply from an ecological perspective - the Earth doesn't have the resources to support the whole current population at that level, even renewables don't regenerate quickly enough to feed that kind of demand. According to the people who release studies about that sort of thing, there's not actually enough capacity to support the world as it is now; we just haven't run through all the reserves yet.

I suspect (but don't know) that it would also be difficult to maintain a 'first world' standard of living without using cheap labour from overseas to make the consumer goods we love so much. Without that, things would have to be substantially more expensive and hence less disposable. No bad thing, but something of a change."
Why are we still talking about Snowden?,I agree that the coverage of the actual leaks is being more or less ignored by mainstream media. But Snowden is interesting because his search for a safe haven has shown us that a lot of countries either side with the US on this issue or are to afraid to do anything about it.
Was 2016 actually terrible for celebrity deaths? Is it confirmation bias?

Is aging just a disease to be conquered and eliminated along with all the others?,[removed]
"If a person is sent to prison for a crime in the past, but now laws criminalizing the act are rescinded, would it be right for the person to serve out their term, or should their sentence be revisited and reevaluated based on the law today?","There's already a re-sentencing process in place for prisoners who would receive lighter sentences under changed laws (especially ""three strikes"" drug laws resulting in life imprisonment).  It's not automatic, though.  The prisoner has to file an appeal, and the appeal has to be reviewed by a court to determine how the changed law applies to the case.  Appellate courts usually don't re-try the entire case to prove guilt or innocence - they look at flaws and changes in the sentencing process.  If the sentencing policy (such as ""three strikes"") is no longer valid or doesn't fit acceptable standards, the appellate court will require the sentencing judge to re-sentence the prisoner in accordance with the current policy.  A nonviolent offender with no prior convictions whose only crime was possession of a small amount of marijuana would likely have their sentence quickly lifted on appeal after legalization.  

But legalization doesn't mean that *drug dealing* is suddenly legal.  Even after legalization, there are limits on the sale and possession of marijuana.  Unlicensed sales, or possession of large amounts of marijuana, or running an unlicensed grow op would *still* be illegal, and a prisoner would still have to serve time for them."

"If society were to collapse, what would be some ways to get by?","1) You need a bug out spot. 

Wherever you are, you probably share sources of food and water with quite a few other people. Due to desperation from scarcity, this will need to change immediately because desperate people, while having all of my empathy and still being human beings, can also be dangerous. 

Go to the place where water and food are difficult for most but not impossible for you. I have a bug out bag, but more importantly I have a series of bug out spots I can get to that other people largely know nothing about and that aren't easy places to set up a settlement. You need those, too. Don't tell people about them, never post them online. 

You need fresh water, you need land on which to hunt and/or fish, you need land that can be developed for agriculture, you need land far from collapsing civilization, you need land others are unlikely to want or find. 
_____________________________
2) You need supplies. 

Grow a garden. Like right now. Maybe you have a big yard and you can grow tons of crops, maybe you have a windowsill and some pots, but learn to not only grow your own food, but how to select and save seeds. I have seeds in storage right now that go back to plants I bought 20 years ago. I have really good heirloom tomatoes I've selected for many generations. I have peppers, I have pumpkins, I have green beans, I have more. You can store seeds through the cold months and plant them when it's appropriate every year, you can learn about soil health and irrigation, you can learn about planting plans and the sun, and you can even learn about growing in different zones and what's seasonal based on geography. 

(Oh, and grab a few planting potatoes on your way out of town, they're invaluable.)

Have a basic bug out bag, but also be able to load up your vehicle with basic tools, inside and outdoor. An ax and sharpener alone are invaluable, imagine adding to that other tools like saws and manual drills and picks and shovels and such. 

Have a way to clean water, including the ability to cook, which means pots and pans that can deal with fire and are easy to move. 

Bring light foodstuff that will be difficult to find elsewhere like salt and spices and oils. 

If you're a meat-eater, and you should probably consider it for the nutrition, you'll want trapping and hunting gear. 
_____________________________
3) You need skills. 

Grow food, hunt food, clean water, protect yourself, build a shelter. These are non-negotiable. 

Growing a garden will help to get you off on the right foot, but agriculture for sustenance growing is a completely different scale than most people's gardening hobbies. You need to think about how to grow different foods in different climates. You need to think about nutritional variety, not just growing a few crops but many crops so that you have a wide variety of micronutrients and so you don't get bored with your food. Rice and beans are amazing, but you need vegetables and fruit and nuts and seeds. You need to be able to, in the wilderness, create a healthy loam for your crops. You need pest control. You need irrigation. You need to plan out saving for the winter months. 

Hunting and trapping similarly are complex skills, requiring experience. I don't eat a lot of meat myself, I don't think the keeping and killing of animals is particularly ethical, but I can built traps for animals and I know how to keep and breed animals like rabbits or poultry. Know how to make a snare. Don't rely on a rifle or other firearm, because you will eventually run low on ammunition and frankly you need that for what I'm going to talk about in a minute. 

Water can be cleaned a number of ways depending on possible contaminants. Boiling will kill most pathogens, but it won't even remotely deal with issues like salt or lead, which means distillation (collecting water vapor) could be necessary. There are now survival filtration systems that are really good, but none with which I'm familiar last forever. Same with tablets. 

Protecting yourself can mean predatory and scavenging animals, but it can also mean other humans. In the incredibly depression scenario you're describing, otherwise good and noble people could find themselves choosing between death and the exploitation and harming of others, leading them to make an impossible choice one way or another. There are different schools of thought on this, but many people believe in the right to defend one's self with deadly force. You'll have to decide this for yourself, but should you decide deadly force can be necessary, you'll need to know how to use weapons built to kill. This almost must include firearms. The go-to defense and hunting firearm for survival is rifles, as shotguns and handguns are generally better are shorter distances. Wherever you are, I can guarantee there's a shooting range nearby and classes to instruct on the safe and responsible use of firearms. 

Shelter. Like many of the others, this will have to be done in phases. Phase 1 is short-term, to protect from animals, pests, people, and weather. Think of a hut or a tent built quite near to a fire you can keep going. Phase 2 is seasonal, meaning something that can survive the heat of summer or the cold of winter. Phase 3 is permanent, which usually means a cabin. 
_____________________________
4) You need people. 

No person is an island and even the most introverted and anti-social among us need other people around for their mental and social wellbeing. If you don't have a close group of friends or family with which you know you could survive, you have a job to accomplish over the next few months or years. 

I've done solo survival before, and while one can steel themselves and make busy... eventually isolation becomes torture. Maybe it's your partner, maybe it's a few best friends, maybe it's parents and/or siblings, but have people you can bring and which whom you can live even under stressful circumstances. Collectively you must be stronger than the sum of your parts, to shoulder the burden of such a radical change in living. 
_____________________________

People fantasize about collapse all the time, but I find it tremendously depression and frightening. The scale of suffering of a civilization going from thriving to desperate is unimaginable, and it will multiply itself as the remnants scavenge what's left of itself. 

Let's do everything we can to address the problems with civilization so we can improve and become more sturdy over time, and so we never have to face collapse. "
Why does it seem that western society has such an issue with isolation and mental health? What is the solution?,"I've lived in three developing countries and having grown up in a Western society, I feel I can answer this question. 

Western cultures are work-based and emphasizes self-improvement. There is a lot of thought that if someone is keeping you behind, lose them. You tend to judge people on their merit, and if they cannot keep up, it's ""all-fpr-yourself"" mentality. 

That goes for almost every aspect of life. Family members gorging on food and ruining your diet? Eat alone. Friend cannot keep up as a running partner? Run alone. Feeling like your classmates don't understand the material as fast as you? Study alone. You enjoy your job and feel like your spouse is being needy? It's perfectly fine to dump her and concentrate on your career. Partner cannot take vacation at the same time as you? Go on holiday alone, forget them. Have to focus on your work and your friend is distracting you? Tell them to go away. 

It's all about your own happiness, your own happiness, your own happiness. 

Socializing in the West has also been synonymous with ""performing"" as well - we feel like we need to be entertaining or worth the fun in order to socialize. Socializing is an EVENT. It's not just a part of life. Every time we socialize, we need to have ""news"" to share, otherwise....why bother? We have to have interesting conversations in order to be bothered to be around people. We have forgotten that most of life is mundane and we don't want to share that mundane part of us all the time. Even on social media, it's the same - highlights only. 

In developing countries, people are not as work-based (economic reasons). That leaves a lot of time to hang out, chat, chill, loiter, smoke.....I've been in North Africa, Middle East, Mediterranean, East Asia - people always do things together. They wait for other people. Even small tasks like - going to the store - people go together. In the West - ""it's faster if I just do it alone."" A lot of daily life is based off of helping others, instead of ""taking responsibility for yourself."" 

We spend too much time working on ourselves, being self-absorbed, trying to be independent, responsible, self-sufficient - then we end up lonely. "
"If Democracy requires a sufficiently educated populace, what form of government is best for an uneducated populace?","Theocracy.  Set down an unarguable set of rules mixed with a moral code and ""divine doctrine"" that plays on emotions (fear and awe largely) and you have a system of populace control that is beneficial in the short term until times are better and the populace more educated.  In more primitive times one could argue that the human race was better off under, and maybe even needed, theocratic rule, because the rules helped moderate the animal nature and establish rules for basic hygiene and civilization.  It becomes obsolete over time, however."
"If Republican = small gov, shouldn't they support gay marriage?","Because the US has only two major parties (this is due to [Duverger's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law) and the FPTP voting system in the US), the parties tend to be coalitions. While the Republican Party of the latter half of the 20th century tended to be known for ""small government,"" these days it is only one constituent group. The Republican party also has a large contingent called the ""religious right,"" which strongly favors traditionalist values. Generally, the ""small government"" conservatives focus on economic policy and cede social policy to the religious group.

Additionally, with the rise of the alt-right and Trumpism, even the ""small government"" economic philosophy is disappearing from the Republican party.

Getting EMRs to talk to each other would be nice.  I've transported patients to hospitals they aren't used to due to patient census, and I am SO FUCKING TIRED of being told by patients, ""Oh, all my medications are in The System.  You know...The System at the hospital you aren't taking me to!""

 There's a standard that allows all PACS programs to interface for radiology (called HL7 I think) , why not regular EMRs?"
"It is often said that humans are by nature social animals, but why do so many people today struggle with socializing and forming relationships/making friends?","It’s more suitable to say humans are *tribal* animals. We have very strong instincts and predispositions for an “us and them” mentality. Throughout our evolution, we have thrived in small groups with similar genetic profiles. We have ingrained behavior to want to support humans that are like us, and to be skeptical or downright aggressive towards those not like us. I would rather provide food and shelter to someone who may be my distant cousin, because they share more of my genetic makeup than someone from another tribe.

Apparently our definition of “like us” is solidified in early development, so the types of people you’re exposed to early on you will be more accepting of. That may be part of why “city folk” are more accepting of immigrants and social justice than people from rural areas with homogenous populations."
How come sex and sexuality is taboo despite being the most natural biological behavior.,"There's a lot of answers here that are only obliquely chipping at the truth, but it all comes down to one massive change that happened in society:

Agriculture.

Before that, paternity mattered far less and social units were formed around small groups rather than nuclear family units. Also STDs weren't as big of a deal before this, because there wouldn't be much sexual contact outside your core social network of a few dozen people.

Consider that, in the timeline of human history, agricultural civilization is a tiny slice of homo sapiens history. Thus, answers that assume the reasoning of settled, patriarchal societies don't really explain the big picture.

When food started to come from claimed land and the population exploded, sex became more dangerous and paternity became an economic asset. Thus, taboo.

There's a lot of edgelords claiming that it's because of religion, but organized religion was also a product of agricultural values.* Economic agendas and stranger danger were the egg that hatched these chickens, not the other way around.

*For fun food for thought, consider that many early religious structures (stonehenge et al.) are centered around solstices and keeping track of time. Why is this? Because i gotta know when to plant the wheat fam"
"Is classical music objectively one of the most musically complex and technically demanding genres of music to ever exist? Is the idea that classical music being inherently ""superior"" from a music theory standpoint justifiable?","Well, I would say that objectively, orchestral music (as opposed to ""classical"" music, which arguably only covers the music written between approximately 1730 and 1820 - Mozart was the peak of that period, coming after Bach but before Beethoven) from all eras is ONE of the most musically complex and technically demanding genres ever. The reason why is because, as a composer, you cannot just sit at the piano and plunk out some notes - you have to master the art of orchestration, which is the difference between an artist drawing a building and an engineer figuring out how to build it, make it stable and functional, and keep it within a budget. The great orchestrators who are still known today are not just the best engineers, they are also the ones who pushed the limits of the ensemble and the forms of the day into new territory, taking incredible chances (that didn't always work out in their time. See: Stravinsky's disastrous debut of Rite of Spring) and expanding what is generally acceptable to an average listener. 

These people are thinking about dozens of factors that are difficult to keep from crashing into each other, including instrument limitations (most wind instruments only have about a two octave range of practical usability, along with other technical limitations (can't write fast passages between low Bb and B for the average trombone, for example)), low interval limits, what the volume is in real life of a part that says ""Violin II"" and how that balances with everything else, considering you only have a single Violin II part on your score but 8 players on stage, physical distance between percussion parts (as an average percussionist switches between multiple pieces per tune), how a non-mechanically-timed section is to be communicated to all players, transposing instruments, chord scale clashes, the list goes on and on. 

And because they can rarely know ahead of time exactly who will be playing their part, do they assume they'll have players who can execute all of their ideas in perfect time, with perfect intonation (which becomes harder and harder once you get into the music of, say, Bartok), etc etc? Those players have to be technically perfect for every note, and require the highest caliber performer who has dedicated their lives to their instrument.

Or, do they assume they'll have lesser caliber players, and hold back on their writing? The great composers wrote without limitation, and we are better off because of it, but over several centuries the average instrumentalist is now required to masterfully play everything from baroque music to post-modern pointilistic music with no real tonal center. If you are a trumpet player playing Beethoven, you only have 3-4 notes to deal with, because he wrote for straight trumpets, which predated valved trumpets, but you have to nail those notes. In the same concert you may have to play a Schoenberg piece that uses every note on your horn, and where you almost never repeat the same note twice in a row.

Jazz took this to a new level by requiring improvisation on various levels, but there's a reason why [Duke Ellington insists he had a jazz orchestra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhpqIMor2P8) (rather than a band or something). It only took a few decades for jazz to evolve to a point of crossing paths with classical music (the ""third stream"" as they called it in the late 40s and 50s), and now you have one of the most successful and influential jazz groups, Maria Schnider's Orchestra, full of symphony-caliber players.

Sorry to ramble, what I'm getting at is that yes, orchestral music from every era, but almost certainly even more so in the 20st century, is objectively SOME of the most complex and technically demanding genre of music to ever exist. And this is coming from a rock and pop fan, to my core, but almost no rock or pop has similar amounts of technical complexity. Even the most complex rock bands, say, Dream Theater, who was mentioned in this thread, only deal with five instruments, of which only four have notes to deal with, and of which all of them have very wide ranges and similar/flexible timbres. There is a physical technicality involved and I couldn't possibly downplay the time signatures and phrasing and non-Ionian scales involved, plus the fact that it's straight up good music. But if the question is about comparing anything else to orchestral music, orchestral almost always wins in terms of being the peak of western musical accomplishment, as it's a combination of both pure musicality and undeniable masterly technical ability.


Oh, and to comment on Gould, who I also love, I think I disagree somewhat with his sentiment. I would need a historian to step in, because I don't know about the average persons musical knowledge in the 19th century and earlier (my gut tells me that only the upper class trained their own, while the lower class dealt more with folk music, but I might be oversimplifying things). In general though, nowadays, as long as we continue to require several years of music in elementary school years and possibly even music appreciation type classes in college years, our musical literacy will do just fine. The thing is, with the tools we have now (Pandora, Spotify, Youtube, iPods, etc), it's very easy to learn about things. The hard part is A) There is SO MUCH music these days that it's impossible to master all of it, as previous generations were able to accomplish, or get close to, and B) The downside of easy access to music makes it just as easy to not engage with it past a superficial level (how many of you know people who only listen to a type of music when it's on in the background of studying or or cleaning?)

Ok, giant post, gotta stop now.

tl;dr - Music owns and all of it's good :)"

Why is the n-word still so commonly used in the USA despite it seemingly to be no longer socially acceptable or politically correct?,"It's used colloquially among black speakers of [black English/AAVE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_English) as an idiomatic term of vocative address (like calling people dude or guy or whatever). The interplay between this usage and the word's history and current usage as a slur is complicated, especially with the many cultural products (movies/songs etc.) that use black English that are also part of the wider overall cultural milieu.

There's no easy answer for you, but it definitely doesn't have to do with free speech or anything like that. Language is an organic, evolving thing, and people use it how they use it. There are many varieties of English and they treat words differently -- what you're observing is really a difference in dialects of English.

"""Russia Wouldn't Stand a Chance in a War with the West"". Why?","He should have qualified the statement a bit better. He should have said, ""Russia have no chance of winning a conventional, non-nuclear, war against the West"". In that, he is correct, they would lose, which is why they will not start one. Even if the US did not involve itself, and it was Russia vs Western Europe, my money would be on Western Europe. 

Russian conventional forces are not at the level that they were at at the time of the cold war, their fleet is a collection of poorly maintained vessels, which limits their expeditionary capability to locations they can reach over land or by air (over friendly or neutral nations). Their military is smaller than it was, mostly conscript based, and is shrinking due to the demographic issues that Russia currently suffers from. In a stand up fight with a numerically equivalent Western force from, say, France, the UK, or the US, I don't see how they could possibly win.

Russia has geopolitical aims which essentially boil down to annexing or dominating the nations of the former Soviet Union. In places like the Baltic and the Ukraine, the tactics have been what ""Yes, Minister"" once called ""salami tactics"" - take a slice of a country here, a slice there, but never formally declare war, and always paint yourself as a victim defending the interests of Russian ethnics in the target nations.

"(Warning, this is dark) Why do suicidal parents so often kill their kids first?","Mercy killing. If life is so painful that you want to die, then you want to prevent the child from going through that same pain. 

If it's difficult to understand a suicidal mind, you need to put yourself in the situation and scale it up to one where you would want to kill yourself. 

Say a horde of flesh-eating zombies has surrounded your house. You have a kid in there with you, and a shotgun with only two slugs. There's no escape. The zombies are banging in the door and it's only a matter of minutes before they get in and eat both of you alive, an excruciating death. So you choose the painless way out: you'll shoot yourself with the shotgun. But do you just leave the kid there to be eaten, or do you put her down first so that she doesn't have to suffer?

Yeah, it's a fantasy scenario, but I was trying to think of one where most people would choose to kill themselves rather than suffer the worse fate. "

"Why has culture declared watching TV and using the computer as negative activities, while reading is thought of as positive?","While all of those activities can be mentally engaging, I think the real reason why we think less of TV and internet browsing as opposed to reading is because reading is seen as an *active* form of media whereas TV and web browsing are seen as *inactive*.

What I mean by that is that when you watch TV, you are fed content.  It's presented to you, and there's no mental processing required.  Yes, certain shows make you think and are engaging, but not while you're watching it, only afterwards upon reflection.

Reading, on the other hand, requires focus and a mental discipline not required by TV *while you're doing it*.  Think about it this way: how many times have you read something so meaningful, so striking, that you stopped reading for a second so you could reflect on it?  Now how often have you done that with TV?

Okay, okay, so maybe you've done that with TV too, but I think it's safe to assume that one happens more than the other.  And while I don't think TV is completely mindless, it's just more mindless than reading.  When comparing the two, it's easy for TV to seem more negative.

The internet, on the other hand, is miscategorized.  While there is a mindless entertainment side of the internet (cats videos, memes, etc.), there's also an extremely engaging side of the internet that allows people to actively participate in discussions, like this one.  The internet allows many people to express their ideas and find new ones.  It also allows to be more aware of the world and its events around us.  I believe that the negative perspective cast upon the internet comes from the fact that it's shown on a screen.  I think TVs possibly stigmatized screens.

And since we're talking about mass media here, I think I'll go off on a tangent and mention video games.  Video games also have a rather negative connotation to them, especially when adults mention that they play with them.  The industry is still seen as a toymaking industry, which is quite unfortunate because it's potentially more engaging than any other type of media there is due to its interactivity.  It's a shame that it has the least amount of credibility even though the field contains so many [interesting](http://www.necessarygames.com/my-games/loneliness/flash) and [thought-provoking](http://www.molleindustria.org/everydaythesamedream/everydaythesamedream.html) games.

(Note: I might be a little biased because I secretly really want to be a game developer.)

tl;dr While TV can be engaging, it often only is upon reflection and not while you're watching, whereas reading is often engaging while you read.  The internet shouldn't be lumped with TV, but unfortunately is.  Then an off-topic rant about video games.

How to stop constantly reflecting over everything all the time,"Yes, I have a mild form of this. The term I've heard describing this is ""rumination"", repetitive/obsessive self reflection, which I think is often associated with depression and anxiety. Here's one random article: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/depression-management-techniques/201604/rumination-problem-in-anxiety-and-depression

For me personally, cognitive behavioral therapy helped in countering negative thought patterns (the book ""Feeling Good"" by David Burns was what I used). I'm not sure if it's as useful for your type of rumination, but could be.

"How is it possible that no one is charged for breech of Oath, when they take a seat in government, and start lobbying for unconstitutional regulations and law?","This comes down to the ""No Higher Power"" problem.

The question is **who** determines when someone is breaking their oath? 

Is it enough if **you** think they are? It is enough if **51% of the voters** think they are? How would we know what the voters are thinking? Guess we'd have to hold and election. Well, what about if the **District Attorney** or **Attorney General** brought suit if they thought an oath had been broken? But then, what if the DA or AG is politically on the side of the alleged oath-breaker? Or what if the DA or AG is politically against the supposed oath-breaker and is bringing a ""breech of oath charge"" just to get at them. And then who would charge the DA/AG with breaching *their* oath? Maybe we should let the president decide?

Why do we shelter children from nudity?,"For whatever reason, we conflate nudity with sexuality. Part of that is probably coincidence. Our species evolved in warmer climates than those in which our most influential cultures have arisen. When you wear clothes all the time to stay warm, being nude has a more deliberate connotation. The act of being naked implies a purpose, and there aren't many purposes to choose from.

I think it's a mistake, though. Kids don't know that there's anything wrong with nudity until they're told that there is."
"For those from a non-Christian country, how is Christianity viewed in your culture? Are there specific stereotypes or rumors that surround the religion?","Indian here. Christians are perceived in a weird way here. They are a minority and mostly represent the ruins of British rule. I studied in a Christian convent school (experience was pretty bad). I will say they are perceived neutrally. Many schools here are Christian schools and people happily admit their children in these. The problem happens usually about marriage. A neighbor of mine wanted to marry a Christian and our society (and of course her parents) were against it. Even though they got married, they later separated and now getting a divorce is complicated since the laws for Christian and Hindu marriage are different and in this case, it is an inter-religious marriage so it makes things more complicated.

So, yeah, they are perceived neutrally. But yes, right wingers often hate them because of Hindu nationalism (which is against Abrahamic faith) and the fact that Christian missionaries often try to proselytize people."
Should Depressed People Be Allowed To Kill Themselves?,"Some people may say suicide is a selfish act but forcing someone to stay alive is also a selfish act too. Nobody chose to be born into this world so no one should have the right to force someone to stay in this world. I think if an extreme depress person did everything known to overcome their depression then they should be allowed too. People who have depression from a fresh romantic breakup, failed the final exam, was embarrassed by their crush shouldn't be encouraged to kill themselves off the back because most likely they can overcome their depression with therapy and our best friend Father Time."

The question isn't so much whether a candidate has a colorful past, but how stark the documentation is. So I don't think your candidacy will be killed by having your porn history - but if there are Facebook photos of you doing something especially stupid or awful, like destroying someone else's personal property, making lots of hateful slurs, etc., your candidacy will be in jeopardy.

Will the USA rise and fall similarly to how Rome did? What are some of the parralells and differences?,"It’s extreme oversimplification to say the least. As two have already pointed out Rome took centuries to decline, and the similarities are only on the surface. 

For one, Rome’s issue was mainly that their entire northern border was with non state entities. Rome and Persia, while not fully modern states, were centralized political entities with central taxation and administration. Outside of them there wereTribes of varying complexity. Tribes that, when pressured, could simply pick up and move as entire fluid political units. This meant that at any time either power could have independently run polities pushing into their borders. Rome has the misfortune of having hundreds and hundreds of miles to defend against such groups. 

Second, Rome early on enjoyed a massive demographic advantage over Tribal Europe. Demographic expansion in the Med in the  last millennium spread from the Near east west, reaching Italy around the time the Roman Republic was supposedly founded. (All Roman record prior to 380 BCE were lost when Rome was sacked) Spreading north with and slightly ahead of Roman expansion Rome was able to tap into her much higher supply of manpower. This advantage would dry up as Rome entered the 2nd century CE. So when Augustus set the borders Rome was more than able to man her borders. However as time went on, the Tribes beyond grew both in population and political complexity. 

Third, Rome achieved her height of power prior to the appearance of True plague diseases. The Antonine Plague, starting in 165, was the first serious plague and it of course wouldn’t be the last. Mainly devastating settled communities, plagues would do much to offset the advantages between the civilized powers and their Tribal neighbors.  

Despite all this Rome took forever to fall. Rome was absurdly stable considering how large and diverse it was. By the time her issues really began to tear the empire apart Rome had managed to fully incorporate the many peoples of the Mediterranean. Syrians, Egyptians, Greeks, and everyone else all viewed themselves as Romans. Every internal conflict the Romans fought, was considered to be a civil war. Every one was always one commander looking to siege power. Never a local looking to form an independent kingdom. Even the Palmyrene and the Gallic empires, these were efforts by Local Romans to see to defending local Romans from the aggressions Emperors had failed to defend from. 

Because of that, Rome managed to survive in the East despite there being very few Latin speakers. Still slowly declining, but clinging on to and scraping back what they could. Rome represents what is likely the most surprisingly stable and lasting state humans have ever created. 


The US could follow a similar trajectory. If climate change turns out to be truly apocalyptic and massive numbers of people are displaced over the next century or two then an analogue to Romes’s decline is really possible. 

However, for the US to follow Rome in its decline the US will actually have to prove to be a survivor. We will need to survive as a state despite the world collapsing as we know it. Even if we lost territory, even if half the nation fell into permanent chaos. The US would need to not only make it past the end of the world as we know it, America would need to survive into what ever stable geopolitical reality emerges centuries after a climatic collapse. 

Then, centuries from now, after we’ve survived and partially recovered from generations of trauma and turmoil we finally receive a mortal blow that leads to the fall of our country.  "
"Those that have failed out of college, what caused you to fail and how have things turned out as a result?","I failed out of an Ivy League university after my freshman year. 

The first issue was a lack of supervision. It was my first time being on my own and being wholly responsible for my own actions. There was nobody to force me to get up, nobody to make sure I went to class, nobody to make sure I went to bed before 6am. My second semester I had a class where I did not attend a single lecture. I was not ready for life on my own.

The second issue was largely emotional. I took 40 hours my freshman year and was still behind schedule if I wanted to graduate in 4 years. I wasn't used to studying for tests, I wasn't used to hours upon hours of homework. I found it extremely difficult to learn in a large-class lecture setting where I had no interaction with the professor. I was almost immediately overwhelmed, and the unfamiliar feeling of failure was terrifying. I ran. I hid. I lied to myself that everything would be fine. I watched my dreams crumble around me. A few professors reached out to me to help but accepting their help would have meant acknowledging my failures.

I still vividly remember the day I received the letter that kicked me out. I couldn't bear explaining it to my Dad; I just handed him the letter, turn around, dropped to my knees and cried. 

Unquestionably the worst day of my life. 

Everything, truly *everything*, that I had accomplished before that day was now erased. All the dreams I had, everything I worked so hard for throughout high school was now void. And the worst thing was that I couldn't start over with a clean slate- I was stuck with a full year's worth of classes with a 1.low GPA.

I spent about 8 months in a severe depression. No job, skipped a semester of school, put on a bit of weight, rarely left the house, standard stuff. Started going to community college but my heart wasn't really in it. I had no direction whatsoever. 

One day I realized that doing anything was better than doing nothing. I started trying in my classes. A friend of mine got me a job, and I was promoted after about a month. I lost the weight. I met a girl. Things didn't really work out with her, but it was the first time in almost a year I felt wrong for hating myself.

Spent 5 semesters in community college rebuilding my GPA and figuring out what to do with my life. I payed for all of my classes with my own money. CC grades were pretty good, I didn't have any semesters lower than a 3.5 GPA. I managed to get a transfer scholarship to a local public university. I live with my parents and work 30-35 hours a week in order to pay for my books and classes.

I got a 4.0 my first semester after leaving community college. It was my first time getting a 4.0 in college and a stark contrast to my first year. The feeling was truly indescribable. I'm in my 3rd semester now and still doing well. I love what I'm doing.

I still lie to people about why I changed schools after my freshman year. I still think about how if I'd just done the work I'd have already graduated and be making 100k+ per year. I hate catching up with people from high school and attempting to explain my situation. I still have issues with self-doubt and aversion to risk taking.

**tl;dr: Failed out of Ivy League school freshman year because I wasn't prepared for that environment. Was a depressed bum for a while. Got my shit together, got a job and payed my way through community college. Got transfer scholarship to 4-year school, doing well.**

My only regret is wasting so much of my parent's money that first year. I don't regret failing, I learned an invaluable lesson about how talent is meaningless without hard work. My life reached it's lowest point when I was 19, and I will fight tooth and nail to make sure I never end up anywhere close to failure again."

"As a foreigner watching a lot of American TV, I gotta ask: is going to jail in the US that bad?","It varies a lot by what part of government is responsible for your incarceration. A little background: Because we have a federated system, there are state crimes and federal crimes. If you just snap and kill your partner in your home, you've committed good old fashion murder, which isn't a federal offense, but it is a state felony. Your state will prosecute you and put you into a state prison. But if you're a drug dealer and are caught moving cocaine across state lines, you're probably going to be busted for federal felonies. A federal court will convict and sentence you. 

Federal prisons are administered by the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and each state has its own corrections department.

In *theory*, all prisons should offer a certain minimal level of care for inmates, because they're all required to meet constitutional requirement for Due Process and are prohibited from having Cruel & Unusual Punishment. However, in practice, prison conditions often don't meet those requirements.

California is a good example. It's very overcrowded, mostly because of the war on drugs and CA's Three Strikes Law, which gives people very long mandatory sentences for committing a third felony, regardless what it is. But in 2011, the Supreme Court ruled that California's overcrowded prisons violate our Eight Amendment, so California's being forced to release a lot of convicts.

It also varies a lot by the degree of your offense. Some prisons are minimum security, reserved for relatively light sentences. At many of them, prisoners are allowed outside with light supervision to do work in the area. Others have higher security, up to the point where some prisoners spend 23 hours a day confined to a cell alone. 

Then there's jail and civil confinement. I assume when you said ""jail"" in your title you actually meant prison. Jail in the USA usually refers to local facilities under the control of police and sheriff departments. These are the places you get sent while you're under arrest and/or awaiting trial, but before you get convicted. So whenever you watch a Western movie and some guy gets into a drunken brawl and thrown behind bars? That's jail, not prison.

Jail conditions can range from ""not that bad at all!"" to horrible. Jails often have much less supervision than prisons because they're viewed as ""temporary."" If a jailed person wanted to sue the state for the conditions of the jail, his claim likely won't be heard, because the courts' view is that he'll eventually get a trial, which means he'll either be released entirely or sent to prison. Unfortunately, because many locations have very back-logged systems, people can spend years in the ""jail system.""

Finally, there's the civil confinement system, which has quietly grown to become a major component of the justice system in the USA. This system come into play when there's a *civil* adjudication that a person needs to be confined for their safety and/or the safety of others - involuntary commitment.

Interestingly, *lots* of sex offenders get into this system *after* they're released from prison! Here's a typical example in my state of Illinois: A man is convicted of a sex offense against a minor and sent to prison. He serves two years. However, at the end of his release, the State files a petition in the court to have him evaluated for civil commitment, under the theory that he has some kind of irresistible compulsion to act again. After some evaluations and reviews of his behavior in prison, the court might decide he needs to be confined for public safety. The man is then ""released"" from prison, only to be put into a different facility for the civilly confined.

*Technically* this isn't prison, since he's not being sent there for a crime by the court. It's more like he's being sent to an asylum for treatment. But obviously in effect, the guy is still locked up. And these facilities often are pretty nasty; part of that comes from the fact that society deems the people in them to be the worst of the worst. And don't get me wrong - a lot of the people who wind up in them are *monsters* - repeat child rapists, for instance, who had previously spent 10 years in prison only to commit another rape the very day after their release. But others are people with much more mild offenses, like Reddit's favorite stereotype of the 19 year old man who gets convicted for sex with a 17 year old girl who had notarized documents that said she was 45.

Overall, jail and prison probably aren't as bad as what you've seen on TV. *Oz*, for instance, takes all the worst notions of prison and some of the worst stories of the last several decades and just crams them into a few seasons. "
"Is it naive to think a ""Pedophiles' Rights"" movement is gonna happen soon, or ever?","It depends on how people phrase the message. I think if they articulate themselves like you did - ""the right to not be demonized, persercuted and discriminated for your sexuality"" - then that movement probably won't get off the ground. I think most people are going to scoff at the idea that it's wrong for them to be grossed out at pedophiles. The most morally upstanding pedophiles are people who are fighting to not molest children. I can see how that's pretty laudable in a certain sense, but at the same time, having urges to do horrible things doesn't make you very sympathetic. 

But if the focus is on help and support for what is obviously not a choice and a very desperate situation, then yeah, some people might be able to get behind that. I think it's important for a pragmatic approach to be taken in this case. If that happens,  yeah, I could see some movement towards treatment options instead of blanket hatred and vilification. I don't think it'll ever compare to something like the gay rights movement, but something could happen. "

A common argument against the electoral college is that the cities will control everything and the poor rural folk will be left behind and marginalized. Why is this a bad thing?,"The system as it is now gives much more weight to only certain rural states. Many rural states are ignored due to the Electoral College. Candidates don’t campaign in Montana, Kansas, or West Virginia. And they spend time in big cities in Florida, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. So the only states that matter to politicians are the so called swing states.  And while people like to say that rural voices would be ignored if we abolished the EC, the truth is right now if you are a Democrat in a red state, your vote does not count. Same if you are Republican in a blue state. The EC actually disenfranchises people.
Why should the a rural vote count more than urban vote? It shouldn’t but that is what is happening under the EC. Trump won more districts but the majority of those districts had few actual people. When the candidate who loses the popular vote continues to win, it’s a problem. No matter what anybody says the fairest way to elect a president is one person and one vote. So to answer your question, it’s not a bad thing. And it’s not “cities” who are voting,  it’s the people in them."

"Can people, one day, from all over the world simultaneously live a 'comfortable' life?","I like to think that it is possible, but I doubt that we will last long enough to make it happen. It would take generations of reprogramming our brains to free us from superstitions and prejudice. We're basically animals who have developed intelligence, and we seem to use that intelligence to find ways to be better animals. 

A lot of people have thought about this: Jesus and Marx being the two most famous. Jesus thought the answer lay in man's relationship to God and Marx thought the answer could be found in economics. Both of these boil down to man's relationship with others, since man invented both God and economics."
"In a romantic relationship, where is the line between asking someone to compromise (good) and asking someone to change (bad)?","I don't think anyone can really answer this for you, but I imagine compromising is like asking your partner to reconsider a choice - (ie: would you schedule your soccer games closer to home so you can pick up groceries  after?) 

Change is more like asking someone to alter something fundamental about their personality (I don't like that you play soccer all the time - would you be a less competitive person?) 

In practice, I think these two often run up against each other, even in couples where people have perfect intentions. And a lot of relationship strife comes when one (or both) people have compromised so often on little issues that it's effectively piled up into trying to change. 

While I think the conventional wisdom to not try to change your partner is good, it's also a bit misleading because people do change as they grow older and more committed, and you don't want someone who is completely resistant to that. I think the crux of that wisdom is that the way someone treats you NOW is likely to stay the same, so you should not enter into a relationship with someone with the expectation that they'll suddenly become more romantic, or more committed, or more sexual, etc.


Hope this helps!

Why is the right to die such a controversial issue?,"Here's a basic answer for you (for lack of seeing a more complete one). I'm not quite sure what you were referring to, medically assisted suicide or regular suicide, so I'll address both. Part of the answer tends to lie with the pressures associated with it. In the United States, although not untrue in certain other parts of the world, medical care can be associated with extremely high health insurance costs. For an elderly person who may or may not have much longer to live, avoiding passing along mountains of debt to their significant other or children who may not be able to afford it could be the driving incentive behind medically assisted suicide. The other side of the coin is that relatives may pressure these people into death, be it to avoid debt or (a more powerful incentive) early access to their will, money, property, etc.
For suicide, the reason why I've heard it's illegal (within the US, not sure about elsewhere) is because making it illegal allows police to intervene and potentially stop someone who is suicidal. While I cannot vouch for the truth of that statement, it seems to hold water and makes sense."

How do I interview job candidates in a way that avoids unconscious racial bias?,"In the pre screening process (resume only, no physical presence or visual), try to find a way to hide the name of the applicant. This will slightly lower the risk of racial or gender bias.

To what extent should we sacrifice our lives for our disabled siblings?,"I think it depends on how you view the concept of family. One view is that the parents chose to have children, and like anyone knows or should know, something could go wrong. It’s their responsibility to provide for the child and the siblings can contribute if they wish, or live separate lives.

Other people might feel like the genetic bond is important enough to honor that, even in the case where reciprocity is impossible, it is still right and, in an abstract sense, beneficial to meet any obligations and duties that arise from the misfortunes of an immediate family member, especially when that family member cannot fend for him or herself.

Ultimately, I think the fairest perspective is to leave it the decision up to the sibling. However, a rational and fair person would at least honestly share with their decision as early and as completely with their parents as possible. E.g. Bob doesn’t want to take care of his autistic brother. It’s better the parents to know this concretely when Bob is 20 and his brother is 18 than to skirt the issue until the parents die and Bob just walks away, leaving his brother to whims of the state."

"If Lee Kuan Yew transformed Singapore from a 3rd world country into a country that has a higher GDP than the US (1 in 6 households have over 1 million dollars in disposable income), and has the least amount of corruption in the world, why don't more countries adopt the same type of gov't?","Singaporean here. There are some things unique to Singapore that other countries will find hard to replicate. For example, the government provided public housing throughout the entire country, which is currently at about 80%. Other third world countries will find it difficult, because of their large size. Singapore managed to continually construct housing throughout the past 5 decades in tandem with population growth. In larger countries, there will always be a district or town that will be neglected due to many reasons, political corruption, construction resources etc. 

Another emphasis for Singapore's government was the importance of education. Education is compulsory up to the age of 16, and guarantees basic math, science and reading skills. It is also very heavily subsidised, where primary school costs like $15 a month, and everything else is footed by the government. This is money being invested that doesn't see a return until 20-40 years later, and if current politicians don't see the immediate return on their investment, its hard to pass reform in the first place. 

Singapore is also a one party democracy, where PAP controls 90% of constitutencies in Singapore, and a unified government won't have 2 political parties bickering and arguing at each other and not getting anything done. Good luck for a political party in a third world country anywhere to sweep 90%, given a fair election in the first place.

There are a lot of state owned agencies as well, e.g. state-owned television and print media. Singapore ranks really low in International Press Freedom rankings as well, and we have pretty tough censorship laws. It's a price to pay in return for this though. At least we won't get FOX-News type of news, but our information is censored here and there. 

We also have tough laws like the death penalty that are enforced pretty harshly that help to keep the streets safe at night. You won't be able to bribe any law-enforcer or state agency in Singapore.  "

If social skills are actually skill then why are they so hard for some people to learn?,"Social skills are skills and I believe there is research behind it, but it is a combination of psychology and anthropology. This is because social traits that are valued in different ways in different cultures. 

While you can define social traits (eg humor, gregariousness, patience, etc) in an effort to quantify skills, social traits are inherently subjective. Part of their impact lies within context and the eyes of the beholder. A joke might be hilarious with your  family, but fall flat with someone you barely know. Same is true with a joke at a bar vs a joke at a funeral. 

Although trying to quantify an inherently subjective skill is difficult, and I would argue it doesn’t get to the real issue. Mastering any skill set, from maths to working a room, will be a different experience for each person. This is due to their unique talents, their prior experience, and how they approach the task. This is why chess masters have different styles and no two comedians are alike. *It’s also why people who are talented or experienced in social skills are also often working to improve those skills.*

Look at how many books exist about improving small talk, persuasive presentations,  networking, leadership, etc. (Check your library for a large and free selection) Social people are always honing those skills. And while they might have talents in that direction, they may be particularly weak in other skills. Perhaps they struggle to grasp music, chemistry, or basic organization skills. I personally struggled with math from arithmetic right on through, but I still passed pre-calc. 

My point is that even if social skills are not where your talents lean, you can still learn and improve. You will notice progress overtime, even if you can’t easily measure it. The human mind is a fantastically powerful and adaptive thing. You may not be able to reach a level of mastery with some others, but you certainly can learn how to make a girl laugh. 

Apologies that I’m not well versed on the particular challenges of the autism spectra. Hopefully someone else can get more detailed and give advice on that topic."
"Why is being willing to die for your country considered to be a good thing, but being willing to die for your religion bad?","I'd argue it's not -- subconsciously or otherwise, you're assuming your country's soldiers are defending something while religious extremists are attacking it.

If the scenario were reversed, and a country was trying to eliminate a religious group (which has happened plenty of times in history...), being willing to die for that religion would be commendable and being a soldier for the country would be reprehensible, worthy of death.

Being willing to die *in defense* of what you believe is a good thing.

Being willing to die *to advance*  what you believe is a bad thing.

Of course, this generalization is subject to sway given specific information about countries or religions and how closely we align with what they're trying to advance/defend. But it's not exclusive to country and religion."

"Transformers 4 wants to film at my business, what are the pros and cons?",[deleted]
Is everything just... escapism?,"I think maybe the best way to answer this is by evaluating the difference between running *from* something and running *to* something. Let’s say for the sake of the discussion we can define what a particular reality is. Let’s say this reality has a negative impact on a particular individual, they find it unpleasant, restrictive, boring, painful, scary, etc. If they seek out and spend most of their time engaging in activities that distract or numb them, making existing in that reality less negative but perpetuating those conditions, that’s escapism. They focus of moving away from what’s negative but are not moving towards something more positive (in the long run at least). The escape is a temporary reprieve but does not truly free them from anything. With escapism there’s a sort of presupposition that you are not in control of reality and therefore can not make changes which a lot of times is true but a lot of times is not.

Whereas if you know what you don’t like about reality and take steps to improve it, whether internal or external, those activities aren’t a brief escape they are a path to more freedom, more control over your own reality.

One is a method for not dealing with reality the other is for actively engaging with reality, whatever nature of reality that may be.

 But it is nebulous. If you describe an innocent man in prison turning inward and meditating deeply, is that escapism or is that enlightenment? If that same man instead does anything, ethical or not, to get out, is that escapism or just seeking freedom?

Some of the very same activities can be powerful tools for both escapism and deep engagement with reality depending on the mindset of the user.

At the end of this ramble I guess I’d have to say that any time reality, whether mundane or existential, confronts you with something you don’t want to accept turning down any path that only takes you back to a place of non acceptance is escapism. There are other choices: making changes in the external or internal conditions of that reality, learning how to accept the things that can’t be changed.

Great question!"
Why is it alright to devote more time and energy to an SO at the expense of long-time friends?,"It’s about exclusivity.

In that case, you’d be willing to drive 2 hours to see them, rearrange your office commitments to make their birthday party, etc. But what if you have multiple best friends? What if he/she has multiple best friends? And what happens if priorities or events between different best friends conflict with each other?"
Why is ethnic diversity seen as a goal in and of itself? Is this healthy?,"I think the idea is that ethnically diverse groups tend to be culturally and socioeconomically diverse.  I have studied with international students from nearly every country of the world.  This has allowed me to develop a broader worldview.  Not only do I have friends with different skin colors, I have friends of different religions, who celebrate different holidays, and who have grown up in very poor countries.  Even among my American friends, I know people who are Native American, Jewish, etc., and I have learned more about their heritage than I could from a textbook.

I do agree somewhat that if a group of white, Latino, black, and Asian students, who grew up in the same city and had and the same socioeconomic upbringing, go to the same university, that the diversity based on ethnic background makes little difference."

"No parent is perfect, so how do you know if they're toxic?","If good parents make mistakes and, for instance, blow up at their kids over something trivial because they themselves are stressed, tired, irritable and so on, they'll later apologise to their children and tell them they overreacted, explain to their children there are other factors which made them react the way they did and tell their children it wasn't their fault.   


Another thing good parents might do: tell their children they are angry about something their child did or did not do, but separate the action from their person. Make it clear you love your child, but that you don't tolerate their action. Sometimes you have to tell it to them explicitly, often you can just show it. Once the punishment is done, it is done. Don't throw at your child what they did in the past, don't bring it up over and over again. 

&#x200B;

Set an example for healthy relationships. Sure, mom and dad will fight once in awhile. They're people with their own personalities and ever so often they clash. But don't bitch about your partner to your children. Kiss and make up where the children can hear it and/or see it. Explain, if necessary, here as well that mom and dad fought over something which bothered (one of) them, but that underneath it all they still love each other very much. Or, if the love is ebbing away - it happens - tell your children that you as parents might no longer love each other, but that the both of you still share their deep love for their children, and that they'll do what they can to be there for them. 

&#x200B;

No parent is perfect. But it's precisely in those imperfections that people can grow.

What are some actual solutions to the issues incels say that they face?,"Comprehensive sex education isn’t a solution, per se, but it sure as hell wouldn’t hurt. How to discuss sex, consent and enthusiastic consent, communicating about and during sex, how flirting works, recognizing wanted/unwanted sexual attention... Sexuality is a skill and, moreover, it’s a communication skill, so you have to learn it in group environments. If someone is socially isolated, it’s going to take longer to learn or they risk learning maladaptive ideas from bad sources. Bonus points because this approach has good effects on “me too” behavior and could reduce the types of ideas that make up rape culture.

The downside is that puritanical helicopter parents, evangelicals and other abstinence-only zealots would lose their shit over teaching high schoolers these essential life skills."
"How does society find the balance between believing the victim and maintaining the belief of ""innocent until proven guilty""?","To start with, innocent until proven guilty belongs solely within the realm of criminal law. It states a presumption that exists until a jury in a criminal case renders a verdict of guilty, thereby exposing the accused to loss of liberty for their crime. If that burden is not met, the presumption applies and you are treated as innocent even if that is not the case. 

People tend to forget that and apply it in all manner of situations that are not criminal trials. So the real question is what presumption, if any, do we apply in any given situation. The answer should be that it depends. 

Think about it this way. Would you require proof beyond a reasonable doubt (which is our actual criminal burden, not proof beyond a shadow of a doubt as you suggested) that a credibly accused child molester was guilty before saying “no, you can’t watch my child”? Of course not. The safety of your child is much more important than respecting the rights of the accused in that situation. You are not exposing the accused to a loss of liberty by denying him the opportunity to babysit your kid. If he is innocent, then it is true that the false allegation will impact his life in other ways, but it’s not necessarily unfair to presume the truth of the accusation in that situation before additional evidence is brought forward. 

This dovetails with the question of respecting the victim. Going back to the criminal arena, respecting the victim could mean listening to that person, taking a police report, and perhaps making an arrest. But if the evidence is simply not enough to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt, the victim deserves to sit down with the person making that decision and hear why. 

“Victim” in the sense you use it is a label attached to a person who accuses another of a crime. That person may or may not be a true victim depending upon whether the accusation is in fact true. Likewise, many true victims never come forward and therefore never are publicly recognized as victims. 

The bottom line is this: All persons deserve our respect as humans. Guilty, innocent, victims, liars, mentally impaired, etc. Whether we pursue a certain course of action following an accusation is beside the point. The circumstances surrounding that accusation should dictate how it will be treated. There is no magical formula other than good judgment.

Why is Austin Texas so liberal compared to the rest of the state or the South?,"Guy who studied politics in Texas here. The truth seems to be that the more urban an area is, the more liberal it tends to be. So actually Dallas, Houston, and Austin are all little pockets of blue, on an otherwise red landscape, if you look at a map of voting behavior. 

That's not just the south either. It may surprise you to look at a map of voting districts and see that states you may have thought were extremely liberal will have red voting districts the further you travel from a major city center.  

If you're talking about the culture being not so conservative then that's a different issue. However I do have some theories about that. "
Is there a sustainable business model for an internet social network that doesn't involve collecting and selling the data of your users?,"Do you just mean personal info (name, email, etc) or also data on user behavior/activity? I'll assume both.

* You can still sell ad space, but without linking it to user data those ads will not be sold at a high price since a target demographic can't be isolated, or not easily anyway.

* If you made the network in such a way that people were exchanging money/services, perhaps you could take a cut of it.

* Charge a subscription (not a one-time thing as that is not sustainable once everyone who is going to sign up is on board)"
Any redditors ever want to be part of a completely different social group?,"So, to preface this somewhat, I'm a third-culture kid who came back to my ""home base"" on several occasions. The first time I lived in home base, I was in seventh grade and made some great friends, and I think that my anger at leaving caused me to remember them slightly more fondly than they actually were, either that or people change. Both are possible. 

So anyway, I have this group of friends right after college, who are all in their mid-twenties and working. Most are pretty smart to very smart, and they're all dudes with the rotating retinue of whatever girls had decided to hang out with them that month. They all have money, either self-made or family money or both. I hang out with these guys because of the since-7th-grade-ness of the relationship with one member of the group. I'm the only girl who hangs out in the group who is not dating one of them. 

They're pretty much my only friends at this point, because I don't like people in general and find it difficult to make friends that I feel like are worth having, so I'm hanging out with them a lot. 

I know that they're superficial and a bit shallow, but I overlook it as they're young and monied and generally have women falling over them, so their being picky as to appearance is one way of weeding women out. 

So, we're heading into DC this one time to go to some douchebag bar because someone in our group won a happy hour tab (someone in our group won a happy hour tab there every time we went, and we only went if someone had won a happy hour tab). Anyway, we're sitting on the metro, and we're talking about whatever, and we hit a stop. The doors open and a trio of ladies walks into our car. 

They are larger ladies. They are very obviously celebrating a bachelorette party. The bride is with them.

My group EXPLODES in laughter. To the point that two of the guys have to *literally walk to the other end of the car to get themselves under control*. It's loud, and the ladies hear it, and they know my friends are laughing at them. I could see their faces; a night of celebration has now been turned into one of self-doubt and shame. I feel like an asshole for even being located *near* these guys on the train, much less *with* these guys on the train. It's the last straw for me (I'm no tiny chick).

I whipped around, looked at all of them one by one with the iciest glare I could muster, and said calmly, ""each of you is single. Someone *loves* her."" 

I moved to the other end of the train, shooting an apologetic glance at the ladies as I moved past, and got off at the next stop. 

I was friendless for a while, but it was 100% worth it.

"Considering the rise of foreign meddling in elections via social media, mass data analytics, deep fakes, and online “echo-chamber” culture, are free and fair democratic elections even possible anymore?","They were never possible at any point in history. There was always some sort of meddling starting from propaganda, campaigns, slander, corruption of various ways and sorts( bribery, rigging etc.) Not all manipulation is bad or evil such as campaigning which is fine.

Still, striving for fair and Democratic elections, for all their flaws, is still the best available option currently until someone comes up with a brand new and innovative system of governance that isn't just another rehashed medieval ideology."

"In a capitalist society, is the transfer of generational wealth comparable to the inheritance of nobility/aristocracy during the feudal age?","I'd say not really. Social mobility was pretty much non-existent during the feudal age. Nobles would have likely retained their estates for many generations, provided they remain loyal to their liege. 

Compare this with a capitalist society, where anyone can amass wealth for themselves and their families. But [70% of wealthy families lose their wealth](https://www.nasdaq.com/article/generational-wealth-why-do-70-of-families-lose-their-wealth-in-the-2nd-generation-cm1039671) by the second generation, and 90% by the third generation.

There are also things like inheritance taxes that prevent too much wealth from passing from one generation to another."
"For the people out there who really fucked up something in their lives, how did you get that together and how that failure has affected your personality?","Flunked out of college twice and wasted my trust fund. Owned my mistakes, started from the bottom - part time job and then community college etc. Accepted it wasn’t anybody else’s fault. Accepted I had done the best I could with what I had at the time, but that I could grow. Accepted that it would take awhile to piece things back together so I was gonna have to buckle down and focus for the long haul. Worked hard and was the best employee I could be even at crappy/inane job, took community college classes at night and studied like a maniac, learned to fail and try again and ask for guidance/help over & over. Started to nurture supportive relationships, stop chasing romantic relationships at the expense of my personal growth, support others, always build people up and NEVER tear anyone down. Found the joy in the grind long-term. I went from unemployable and unacceptable for university, to a bachelors and great career options. It took 6 years. I think I now can appreciate the importance of tenacity and perseverance. I believe in the power of sticking with it and asking for help. "

"Why do only a few individuals get caught for illegal file sharing, and what caused these people get caught over the multitude of peer-to-peer users?","It's essentially like playing a lottery.  The RIAA had to:

1. Get a list of IP addresses connected to a particular file being shared, usually by also connecting into the same P2P network.  And to get a bigger damage charge of redistributing, they look for proof the IP has uploaded, not just downloaded.
2. Look up the owners of the IP, in most cases this is an ISP or university.
3. Coordinate with the abuse departments of the owners of the IP to try and obtain the actual account (with a responsible persons name attached) behind the IP.  If enough time has elapsed, it's possible the ISP no longer has the logs that could identify this.
4. Coordinate with law enforcement to get more details to proceed with a lawsuit.
5. Be successful in court convincing the judge that it was the person they accused who actually did the download, and not someone else on the shared network.  Open WiFi networks sometimes got a few people out of these charges, other times the judge still said the account holder was responsible for any activity on the network.

Many ISPs and courts got tired of the RIAA trying to do mass sweeps.  It costs time, and thus salary of someone to look up what account had what IP at what time.  The RIAA initially tried going right to the courts with just IPs, and wanting the courts to do steps 2-4 for them, but most rejected this.

With all the effort, and places where someone may say no, they tend to get just a few names.  The court cases are then more about the RIAA trying to send a warning to other users.  ""Look at this person being fined 6-7 figures, do you want that?  No?  Go buy music instead.""

Justice also moves slowly at times, especially when compared against the pace of technology."
Who is at fault when sarcasm is lost?,"I think it's a crucial part of sarcasm that not everyone *should* get it, and in that sense, using it very much depends on your audience.

For example, [this clip from a kids' show](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWdD206eSv0) was not intended to be sarcastic, but on reddit, the quote has an unambiguous sarcastic reading, because redditors are experienced (not to mention jaded) internet users.

So when you ask whose fault it is if sarcasm is lost, my answer would be the author, for misjudging the audience.

That said, some readers enjoy nothing more than getting the joke that nobody else does, and hate having sarcasm spelled out for them. The ability to ""get"" internet jokes/references/sarcasm has become a measure of social standing.

If you want to improve the chances of your sarcasm being understood as such, there are some small verbal clues you can include in your writing, such as the adverb ""surely"" or the sentence ""Yeah, right.""

Sarcasm being misunderstood goes back centuries. A good example is Jonathan Swift's essay ""A Modest Proposal"" (1729) in which the author proposes with a perfect poker face that encouraging the Irish poor to cook their own children as food and offer them to the rich to eat is a perfect way to stop starvation and control the population at the same time. Not everyone got the joke at the time. Maybe this is the reason for Swift's quote, ""The hate of fools and fools to hate / be that my motto and my fate."""
Have the terrorists won?,[deleted]
Should law enforcement officers be required to have an upper-level degree (i.e. Bachelors)? Would this change your perceptions of the police?,"Let me preface this whole response that having a college degree does *not* equate to intelligence. I know plenty of folks who do not have college degrees who are brilliant and even more people who have completed college and aren't very bright. However, for the purpose of this hypothesis, I am going to assume there is a general level of intelligence needed to graduate from a four-year institute of higher learning.

Part of the problem is that officers who have higher IQs are routinely have their application rejected [and it's legal](http://abcnews.go.com/US/court-oks-barring-high-iqs-cops/story?id=95836#.UZpwb7W1EWI)

Much of standard police work is a lot of boring repetition with very infrequent, but very high levels of action (of course this will vary greatly by location e.g. Baltimore, Detroit, L.A.). This type of work will generally not appeal to people who are more intelligent. Those police officers who have college degrees tend to be higher in rank with more specialized jobs like a homicide detective.

While the job of a patrol person may appeal to some people with a college degree (but, I will assume that this is a means to an end in order to eventually be one of the specialized officers), those with high intelligence levels will be bored to hell and will either burn out or look for other forms of employment.

I think that if a college degree is required, the applicant pool will be drastically reduced and the turnover rate will be at a much higher level and perhaps lead to an untenable situation."
"So far, the year 2020 has appeared to be pretty consequential for humanity. In what ways do you PERCEIVE our world is changing?","I can only speak for myself as an American millennial, but I feel like the millennial generation in the US is starting to feel the full effect of embracing adulthood. While we spent most of our 20s waking up to the recognition of the problems in the world, we now want to spend our 30s creating the changes that the world has been needing.  These last few months have made me feel so USELESS (I’m a high school teacher), and I can’t imagine walking out into the rest of this year with the same existence or understanding.

I think 2020 has also forced humanity to acknowledge that change is coming, quickly and drastically, no matter how much we want to fight it, and that’s leading to the best and worst of humanity."
"Turning your Life Around (while living with Depression, Anxiety & Trauma)","I'm going through a similar situation at the moment. Our stories  actually intersect in many ways.

I'm currently in a space right now where in appearance - everything looks great. My career is starting to take off, I have healthy relationships in my life, family issues have been somewhat resolved, etc. That being said, mentally I've never felt deeper in the hole. I'm not happy, and im feeling like I'm just getting consumed. I'm tired of pretending to be happy. It's exhausting. 

I do have hope though. Like you, I also have a will to want to be happy and in a good head space. I have hope that we will get there.

Hang in there."
Why do most global conspiracies always circle back around to anti science or antisemitism?,"Because it's the sort of explanation that makes intuitive sense, if you don't know much about science. If you're the sort of person who believes that there is a class of people who are putting one over on the public (and by ""the public"", you think ""people like me""), then scientists are a strong candidate for people doing confusing things that you don't understand, people who seem like they know something you don't and might be taking advantage of you with that.

Some people are so ill-served by the educational system that we almost ask them to take the operation of scientific progress on faith, because science just seems like this alien set of traditions and principles that are practiced by weird priests in white coats. From that perspective, it makes some sense that a person would feel suspicious of that (it's also more appealing to think that you're wise to a grand conspiracy than to confront the idea that you yourself are not that well-informed).

Anti-semitism is trickier and has a more complicated history that I'm not really qualified to opine on. But spending millennia ostracizing people is sure to make them seem like ""the other"". Push a culture outside of your society, then look at it suspiciously for being outside of your society, then use that to justify pushing them further out, repeat."
Is our rage misdirected? Is mass government surveillance really a sign of a more authoritarian government?,"I think both the congressional and executive branch are worthy of blame. Chiefly congress, as they authorized the PATRIOT Act in the first place, but both President Bush and Obama for going along with it. As for the NSA, this is the reason they exist, so I'm not especially surprised. 

I find it difficult to believe that we're truly in an Orwellian police state given that every media outlet, Redditor, and anyone else with an opinion can (and has been) asking that question all day everyday, with nothing to stop them.    "

It can push rankings of its own products.

So.  To a pretty high degree."
"Why don't North Korea's ""allies"", namely China, help the country acquire a more modernized economy, invest in the country and benefit from better trade relations? What does China gain by keeping North Korea an economic dump?","Investment implies a reward or ROI. Off the top of my head here are some questions I would see China having.

* Could China justify sending large amount of capital into North Korea given the instability of the country? 
* How much capital or investment would be needed to help them out of their current state? 
* Would the ROI be worth the investment? Why invest in NK when you could invest in a much more stable economy i.e. buy American debt to improve relations with the strongest nation in the world or invest in helping out a reclusive nation that has many issues to grapple with. 

These are all questions that need to be addressed before investment can be considered. But assuming it gets passed all of those, what type of economic relationship do you expect to have with NK? What can they offer to China other than cheap manufacturing, which China has in abundance. Modernizing NK will take huge amounts of investment and cooperation from the NK leadership.

So that leaves China in its current situation. Their only real concern would be the influx of refugees if NK collapses. A smaller side benefit to China being an ""ally"" with NK would be since NK is somewhat abrasive in the international stage when they sabre rattle, China becomes entity that is called upon to talk some sense into NK.

Should it be considered anti-competitive for Apple to prioritize Apple Music over Spotify within their own product (App Store)?,"Honestly, both of your premises are correct.

It is anti-competitive, but it's also within their rights to do so. 

That's why Spotify made a video instead of sending a lawyer. The only thing that can make Apple change their ways is public outcry, and Spotify knows this. It's also good marketing on their behalf, painting themselves as the 'good guy' VS Apple 'bad guy'.

"If industrial hemp has NO mind altering capabilities, yet can provide clothing, medicine, bio-fuel and so much more, why is it illegal in the United States?","I don't buy the argument that hemp is some sort of miracle plant that would give us all clothing, bio-fuel, etc.  Hemp is legal to grow in many countries, and while it has it's role in the economy there it's by no means doing things like shutting down the logging or cotton industry.  It's just another crop, not a miracle crop, and if it was legal in the US it wouldn't make an enormous difference."
How differently would we design cities from scratch given modern ideas and technology?,"I think one crucial thing is it would be built around mobility and convenience. I see blended districts, with offices, housing, and shops all intermixed, green spaces mixed with transit. I don't really see much infrastructure for cars except to get to mass transit from outside the city, or to leave the city.

Urban geography is really big right now and there are a lot of ideas about reducing energy consumption and waste while instilling a sense of community into neighborhoods. Increased walkability improves security of an area, and community gardens are getting attention and becoming popular again. Cities built from the ground up today would be far less scary, integration of all people and needs could nearly eliminate bad areas.

I wish my courses in this had been more recent, it's such a cool subject."

Why has “optimism” become a synonym for “naivety”?,"I can't speak for the decades that I wasn't alive to experience, but I know in my lifetime the average person seems to feel that their security (mostly financial) is very tenuous...or non-existent. The power imbalance is enormous. The minority of obscenely rich and powerful can do more, influence more, than a collective of middle class people can hope to achieve. 

So, how do we respond? I believe it's with cynicism. Cynicism protects from actions or feelings that can cause tangible and intangible repercussions. A tangible example is being unemployed after getting an English degree, where intangible might be something like our feelings over failing, or over security. If we approach everything with caution then there is lower risk. 

Personally, I find the 'survivorship bias' of the rich, powerful and famous - or those that believe what they say - to be extremely naive. They have clearly little to no appreciation for what it's like to not make it. They're are ignorant of their own luck. Trying or 'not giving up on your dreams' will not be the determining factor in whether or not you succeed in getting into the 1%. They forget this. So, honestly, in this case I believe a healthy dose of cynicism can only help most people. To believe that you're going to make it is much more likely to mean that you're going to be a waitress in LA while you tell all your customers that you're really an actress and this is just your side gig. They'll nod and smile but they are really thinking ""Oh, that poor soul..."""

How much faster would advancements in technology and medicine be made if every single industrialized country suddenly decided to devote 20% of their GDPs to research?,"It depends. In my industry (electric vehicles) the $ per vehicle decline due to increased *production*, not the invention of a better widget. Ultracapitors can store megawatts of energy in a small space, but they’re too expensive. Expensive widgets = risk in the eyes of the customer, so they’re unlikely to sign up for such a device. Thus the groundbreaking widget rots in a R&D lab somewhere. 

(Universities also suck at anything to do with commercializing their own products. The professors are too concerned with teaching and managing grad students, who are the real workhorse anyway. But the grad students don’t have the project management experience of delivering “good enough” research and they get lost in the weeds.)

The best bang for your buck is to subsidize the cost of adopting new technologies, I.e. make EVs cost the same as their fossil fuel powered counterparts. The customer get low risk, innovative tech, and if we sell enough of theses the manufacturers get better at building them. "

I think most of the presidents that are considered good had to do something big that helped people across the whole spectrum, while at the same time not doing something that pissed off their enemies.  Even the best presidents have certain blemishes on their terms, and it would be naive to think they could do everything perfectly."
Would you trade our technological progress for a better environment?,"The premise is ahistorical. Technological progress is *how* we improve efficiency, reduce waste, invent more environmentally friendly products, cut down on pollution.

What I love most are the autonomy and the fact that every completed project is direct physical evidence of my growing skill.  I got here by being terrible at engineering grad school, then doing a lot of soul-searching to figure out what I actually wanted to do all day, every day.  It turns out the answer was: hit metal with a hammer."
What was different this time that caused such a resurgence of the black lives matter movement?,"I think one thing that’s missing from previous (on-point) comments is the rate of unemployment. A lot of people have a lot of time on their hands. They’re choosing to spend Monday through Friday on the streets instead of just protesting on the weekend, and that’s keeping the momentum going."
Are job interviews BS?,"Being able to communicate with your team members and contribute to the collective work of your organization *is* a qualification. 

If you do great work, individually, but cannot function in a team environment, another worker who does marginally worse individual work - but is a positive contribution to the team - is more total productivity added to the total system. 

And very often, it’s much easier to teach job-specific skills than social skills, so selecting for someone who will be positive to the whole organization is prioritized over someone who might be very good at just their specific role.

So if you’re seeing social screening of interviews as “worthless” and feeling like you’re super qualified but awkward - that *perspective* is probably much more the cause of your difficulties than your awkwardness is specific.  It’s important to recognize we’re a society of specialists and individuals’ solitary merits are very very secondary to their capacity for supporting and contributing to the team and organization collectively. In not seeing social skills as *part* of the qualifications for the job, you’re indicating it’s not something you’re open to developing within in order to be a better fit for the job."
I keep seeing articles saying we have past point of no return with regards to climate change. Is this true? What is point of no return? Are there measurable variables that can back up this claim. Is it a completely hopeless situation?,"I think there are several things going on:

- We may be past the point of no return for hitting the target limit of 1.5C or 2C rise.

- We seem to have just found out that there's a big difference between 1.5C and 2C: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report

If she did want to help the homeless she should have donated to one of the many homeless shelters, charities, etc. Or personally bought him food; I've done that from time to time if I'm going into a resturant and they ask for money because they're hungry.

What do you think is next after the internet?,"The non digital age lasted quite a while. I think there is still a lot to be learned and achieved just with regards of how to apply what we have discovered in the last 50 years.

We can already program a computer to recognize commands based on thought, but it has to be taught each command for each individual person. This was true in early speech-to-text technology as well.. but eventually we were able to create speech-to-text that can adapt to many voices and accents. 

As each of our senses/abilities can be learned by a computer, they can become more and more human-like.

Do you think that people who are in jail for something which then gets decriminalised while they’re in prison should be let out?,"Your question really comes down to your view on why you've put someone in jail in the first place.

If you think jail is just punishment for breaking the law then no, decriminalising something doesn't change the fact that they broke the law at the time.

But I'd like to think that most people want jail to keep the general public safe from people who are dangers to the public or to perhaps to change their circumstances so that when they get out they don't go back to committing crime. 

Clearly if the reason for jailing them has been removed then their crime cannot be dangerous to the public in the main. So there should be no reason to keep them locked away. "
"Facebook replaced Myspace, Reddit replaced Digg and similar sites. With Youtube censoring content and antagonizing its content creators- will it be replaced?","Those sites didn't have much in the way of their own content; or rather, much in the way of *lasting* content.

Finding your old MySpace page now is generally hilarious, for example. And like Facebook now, the information is meant to be transient and constantly updated.

Reddit and Digg (and Fark!) are news aggregation sites that happen to have message boards... so also, very transient.

While YouTube *constantly* has new content (what's that crazy stat about how many hours of video are updated every second?), it also has *every friggin video you can think of* already there.

Another huge point-- I don't think YouTube is [even making any money](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2970777/YouTube-roughly-breaking-nine-years-purchased-Google-billion-viewers.html).... while it is a valuable side-property for Google, it shows how difficult it might be to create a competing video service that could stay in business."

"In your opinion, has the anti bullying thing gone too far?","Bullying is a terrible catch-all term used simplify many of the conflicts that are common in schools (and workplaces I guess), and divide the people involved into ""Bullies"" and ""Victims"".

It's never that simple.

Suppose you have 2 situations. 

The first, billy gets cornered everyday by 3 larger kids. They make fun of him, threaten to beat the shit out of him (and do occasionally), and rob him (often ending with a nice punch to the gut). 

The second, whenever Sam (14 years old) tells a joke (often awkward and not found to be funny by anyone), Felix says ""Ugh Sam shut up, you're such a fag"" (or something to that effect). Sam naturally responds with a ""you're a faggot!"" (or something like that). Once in a while it's enough to piss Felix off enough for him to shove Sam to the ground (Felix is much bigger than Sam).

Felix doesn't go out his way to be around Sam (in fact he tries to avoid him), but they are in many of the same classes together, so it happens pretty regularly.


These situations are not even remotely the same. Billy is being regularly assaulted and robbed. That's pretty much criminal. Probably something drastic needs to be done.

Sam and Felix just don't like each other. Sam lacks the social skills to prevent him from being ostracised. Felix lacks the social skills/patience to ignore Sam, or ideally, do his best to include him. Both lack the social awareness to not call each other 'faggots' (and probably the complexities of human sexuality are beyond them anyway). It's possible that they have a closeted gay classmate who feels pretty shit about the regular pejorative use of the word faggot, but frankly, understanding that is probably beyond them.


To paint Billy's situation with the same brush as Sam's (and felix's for that matter), is really wrong. To say that Felix is the same as Billy's bullies is just stupid.

The Kid's beating up Billy probably need quite drastic steps. They are regularly committing crimes, and probably something needs to be done to keep the other kids safe.

Felix and Sam need to fucking learn to get along. And personally, I'm not completely for strong interventions at this point. While it would suck for Sam to have to go through that everyday (and it's also probably not so fun for Felix), it's also good for them to have practice dealing with someone they don't like. 

If Sam is borderline suicidal or something (or Felix is acting this way because he has a bad home life or something), then obviously something else needs to be done - but the root problem isn't the regular altercations between Sam and Felix. Though maybe in these more drastic cases it's worth keeping them away from each other, while the real problems are addressed.

But barring some more sinister root problem, letting them hate each other for a bit isn't terribly bad I don't think."
Why does the US continue to support Israel?,"Two main reasons:

1. Strong Jewish influence. No, I don't mean any type of ""jewish conspiracy"" by that. What I mean is that AIPAC is very effective at lobbying and has several hundred million dollars at their disposal. That combined with influential Jews in positions of power creates an environment that's pretty staunchly pro-Israel.

2. Strategic regional interests. Israel votes in agreement with the US 98% of the time in the United Nations over various issues. Anti-terrorism efforts specifically come to mind. Israel's hostility towards Iran's nuclear program also coincides with US interests. Consider that Iranian leaders refer to America and Israel respectively as the Big and Little Satan.  "

Has anyone ever actually learned a second language solely through public school?,"I spent years learning French in school.  I got great grades.  But I couldn't communicate properly in French when, years later, I met a French girlfriend (later wife).

What I realised through re-learning French, and through having bilingual children, is that language teaching in school (as I was taught it) is pedagogically unsound.

When in school, we were focussed on reading and writing French.  You'd create lists of nouns and verbs to learn.  Listening and speaking were very, very secondary.

When kids learn a language from very young, they do so by listening, listening, listening, and finally making sense of the words, they start to speak, and we correct them, and gradually they build up a vocabulary that is ""direct"", not translated - i.e. they look at a tree and learn the word tree.

Much later, we teach them the written version of the language.

This is important, because languages like French are actually simpler to speak.  The I, you (s) and he/she/it endings often sound almost the same, where as they look very different.  If you're focussed on learning the different last letter between the I and you version of a word like cuisiner (je cuisine, tu cuisines) then you're missing the vibe of the language.

After reading a great book called [The Third Ear](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Third_Ear_\(book\)) and actually spending time in France with my wife, I learned heaps more than in school.

EDIT: Interesting article on ""[learning Danish by Osmisis](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24175429)"".

Also I'm on mobile so I apologize for the big links. 

Yes drug companies have purchased underpriced drugs and raised prices before, see this article for just one example (http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/21/business/a-huge-overnight-increase-in-a-drugs-price-raises-protests.html?_r=0), but the reasons behind this are relatively modern. In the past, and continuing today, drug companies aimed to consolidate the industry. Pharma companies generally avoid early stage research and instead focus on marketing, sales, late stage research, and navigating the drug approval process as their strengths. Because of,this there is a long history of smaller companies being acquired. 

What's changing today is just what he named in the Bloomberg clip, this drug is underpriced relative to its peer group and they want it priced efficiently relative to their peers. He's also correct that people need this drug so while the Mt Sinai doctor says they'll look around if there isn't am alternative treatment approved already then they have to use it. 

These pricing strategies are one of the core reasons behind why healthcare is so expensive. 

It's difficult to judge changes to patient access but it's almost guaranteed that raising the price won't increase access. It won't necessarily decrease access in a significant way though. Most likely what they've judged is that if they raise the price the way they did then most people can still get it at a low cost but wealthy patients and insurance companies will pay so Much more that revenue will jump. What they actually do with that money we will have to wait and see. "
Can you name a scenario which a slippery-slope argument has proven to be valid?,"Here's an example that I can think of off the top of my head:

This was in 1973, when gay marriage was not even an approachable topic of discussion in the our political discourse.

"Is the meaning of a word determined by the intention of the speaker, or the impression of the listener?","This is quite an interesting question and lots of research have been done over the years. I'll try to quickly summarise some key perspectives that I have learned and read a little about.

\-------

**(1) Encoder-decoder model:**

The encoder-decoder model is the simplest model but also an oversimplification and ignores contexts, which can greatly affect the meaning of a given message. In this model, meaning of a word is a property of the message. That is, communication would be about the autonomous processes of encoding (speaker) and decoding (listener) of signals, with no room for ambiguity. There would be a single meaning for each signal (e.g., Morse code), and it would be the listener's responsibility to comprehend the message and determine the meaning.

**(2) Intentionalist model:**

This is similar to the encoder-decoder model in that meaning is a property of the message. However, contexts are taken into account and as such words and meaning do not have a fixed relationship. Communication is thus the exchange of communicative intentions in which listeners must infer the speakers' intended meaning using a 3-stage model:

Stage 1: Listener decode the literal meaning of the utterance (word/ sentence meaning like in the encoder-decoder model)

Stage 2: Listener determine appropriateness of the literal meaning (taking into account contexts)

Stage 3: Listener inferring the speaker’s intended meaning

Listeners accomplish stage 2 through conversational rules (‘maxims’). Violations of the rules would be informative, and would indicate that the listener should look past the literal meaning of words, reinterpret the utterance in light of contexts to arrive at the intended meaning. For example, Person A wasn't invited to a party, yet says “thanks for the invite”. This would violate the maxim of quality and the listener would have to infer and determine the intended meaning of Person A.

**(3) Perspective-taking model:**

One limitation of the intentionalist model is that it does not take into account audience design even though research have shown that speakers tend to design utterances with the destination in mind. In this case, meaning would be message + model of the addressee (e.g., how well you understand/model the mind of your addressee).

**(4) Collaborative model:**

All the aforementioned models assume that speaker and listener are autonomous (distinct roles, speaker produces and listener processes). However, research have also shown that transfer of meaning can actually be a product of interaction between speaker and addressee where meaning is ‘mutually agreed’. That is, in practical communication situations, the respective roles of speakers and listeners are often ambiguous and the determination of meaning would rely upon creating and updating a situational model for each partner. However, this can be cognitively demanding and effortful so the extent to which we actually do this is actually contentious.

**(5) Interactive-alignment model:**

This model represents an alternative inter-personal account of communication that helps explain why giving (and listening to) a speech is difficult; yet holding a conversation is easy. In this model, transfer of meaning is via an alignment process across different linguistic levels such that two communicators converge in their usage of sounds, language structures, semantics, and pragmatics through implicit priming. This process is effortless and it is likely that we use a combination of effortful negotiations and implicit alignments to determine meaning.

\------

I became a little lazy towards the end of my post (Google the models if you want to read more) but basically, in the first three models, meaning is a function of the *message, contexts, etc.*, whereas it is a function of the *interaction* (both explicit and implicit) in the final two models.

How would you confront your racist parents?,"""Dad, when you say X, it makes me feel {uncomfortable, offended, angry, upset}. I wish you wouldn't say things like that around me.""

I learned that way back in elementary school but ""The I Message"" is still paying dividends in my personal and professional life. It's not about judging or put-downs - ""Dad why are you so racist?"" ""Dad why are you so insensitive and rude?"" It's about an observation - he says X - and how that makes you feel. Even though it may not change his opinion, maybe he will realize that his behavior is making you uncomfortable and tone it down a few notches.

Then, there are increasingly blunt phrasings of that same sentiment. Unfortunately, if his behavior is not changing, you might have to resort to ""the nuclear option"" - ""Dad, if you keep saying things like X, I am not going to visit anymore."" And be prepared to follow through with that. "

I don't think it's possible to know, really. Intelligence agencies can't do public post-mortems on their investigations, and compartmentalized classifications mean that even a high ranking intelligence officer only knows the details of their own programs. 

The only people who can truly evaluate the effectiveness of large intelligence operations are the same brass-ranked officers who have political pressures tainting their public statements.

Should an artist’s actions be separate from his work or should they be considered one?,"When we look at the revelations from #metoo and the entertainment industry, it’s easy to see how having such awful people influencing our culture may normalize bad behavior. Woody Allen’s works delve into his fucked up relationships with young women and ephebophilia and Allen’s influence on movies and pop culture has been huge. 

Louis CK’s schtick involved him working out his issues with consent, such as the sexual assault scene in “Pamela, Part 1” of Louie that’s played off as a ho-hum sad Charlie Brown moment.

I’ve been thinking a lot lately about how many reoccurring romance tropes from popular culture may be being propagated by abusers who are working their shit out in their art. Goodness knows that many of us have used romcom tropes as placeholders for experience in early relationships when we’re still figuring out what works and what is healthy. Clearly abusers’ personal lives bleed into their art, so how much of that art bleeds back into viewers’ personal lives...? "
"What would it take to have a revival of strong, uncorrupted workers unions in the US?","Since I don't really know much about union laws, all I can offer is my perspective as a blue collar worker. I'm sorry if it doesn't answer your question.

Having recently worked for Amazon, they really pound it in that ""unions are bad for all of us"" without many more facts as to why, just ""it doesn't fit with our business model"". Companies like Amazon know there is a chance unions and worker revolutions are an increasing possibility but my state is a right to work state and they can fire us for almost any reason and Amazon specifically can find new labor as fast as possible. 

Before Hurricane Irma, worker dissatisfaction at my facility was almost at a boiling point, But then they gave us a week's pay and closed our facility. PR wise, a good move, and it cooled some heads over trying to unionize. Workers need to stick to their guns. I admit I wanted to try to do something and spoke to my friends I trusted would not rat me out, but no one wanted to take the risk to help me, so I gave up. Employees who spoke up at company meetings were vilified and shunned and called whiney. Told to ""quit* if you don't like it."" Others at different facilities who make flyers about meeting to unionize are made fun of on unoffical employee social media pages and talking about unions will get you removed from official closed employee facebook groups. 

Amazon tries their best to keep employees on a fine line of happy and unhappy. Happy enough to stay and work but only that much. With all their strictness, they ""make up for it"" with decent insurance, paying a *little* more than flipping burgers, an employee discount for the site, and free snacks on the crazy short 10-15 minute break times but only on overtime days. Basically, they don't treat you well, but its not a sweatshop in China right? 

People who want to unionize are seen as the people who couldn't ""handle it"". The narrative has changed from unions are the ones who got us medical leave, breaks, and employer paid insurance to the people trying to steal your money by charging dues when they don't ""do anything"" because the work and change was already done, except the clock has rolled back and we lose more and more of what unions worked for all that time ago and we are going to have to fight for it again. 

So individuals have to understand that unions are needed again. My father in law broke his shoulder and his company paid for 6 month medical leave, then the next year they were bought out by another company and he was let go and they paid him $20,000 as severance. Yet he genuinely believes unions are worthless, as if they gave him that out of the kindness of their hearts. "
Why don't you help the poor?,"I'm part of a loose organization known as the [Effective Altruists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism). Basically, we try not just to donate as much money as possible, but also to donate it in the most efficient ways possible. The idea is to identify the most effective charity (right now we believe it to be the [Against Malaria Foundation](http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF)) and give as much money as possible to it. 

What does as much as possible mean? Well, obviously giving away all your wealth and possessions is a terrible answer, since once you've done that your income stream is basically cut off and you can't donate any more. Instead you have to decide whether an expenditure is going to increase your overall donations. For example, education is a very good thing to spend money on, because it should increase your lifetime earnings and allow you to donate more.

It can be very difficult to cut down on luxuries, but in the developed world most people take in far more money than they need to survive, and any money that is spent needlessly comes at the opportunity cost of one life for every $1600 at best estimate.

I don't want to come across as bragging, as a student I don't really make much money so my donations are pretty small. Instead, this post is just to make people aware that such an organization exists, maybe divert some money to a more efficient charity and possibly convince you to consider your purchases more carefully. If you feel like this is something you might want to do or you just want more information, [Peter Singer](http://www.ted.com/talks/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism.html) has a very good TED talk, or you can PM me, I'd be glad to answer any questions or direct you to someone who can."

What differentiates friendship+attraction from true love?,"While many people might not put much stock in a Christian philosophy on love (given a lot of our obsession on sex and not actually on, you know, what makes a good relationship), I think Rob Bell's *Flame* has a good perspective -- according to him, there are 3 types of love necessary to have a lasting relationship, that he takes from the Bible book of Song of Solomon. (As such, he uses Hebrew words to refer to them, so bear with me.)

The first is ""raya"" -- which you have mentioned already, and describes friendship and companionship. Ideally, this includes wanting the best for each other, and even having affection towards each other. 

There is also ""dod"" -- carouse, fondle, the sexual element that you have also mentioned. 

Lastly, and this is the one I think you've missed mentioning, is what Bell (and the Hebrew language) calls ""ahava"" -- the love of the will. Most people call it commitment. He describes it as such: ""more profound than fleeting romantic feelings. ... much more than temporary urges. It's making the decision to join your life to another."" Friendship and attraction mean nothing without a commitment to a relationship. In this sense, love is not just an emotion, it's an action and a choice. You can't have a successful relationship unless you're occasionally willing to make sacrifices, recognize differences, hash out disagreements, and grow with each other. Because in a sense, no two people are ABSOLUTELY perfect for each other. There is a certain level of compatibility that a relationship starts with, and then any more compatibility a couple has is a result of their working together to grow together. And that willingness to work, that commitment, and that desire to continue to work together, is what keeps a relationship going even when it hits rocky spots. So if one or the other person isn't willing to put in the work and commitment, then a relationship simply won't happen. "

"If Kim Jong-un woke up one morning and genuinely decided to turn over a new leaf and become good, Would the world let him? or would they kill him and start with a new leader?","This is a cool question. I'm answering it as someone with a degree in political philosophy.

You don't have to be more than reasonably familiar with North Korea in order to understand the game theory at play over there. Kim Jong-un's regime is critically dependent on a two-pronged power source that has to be constantly **renewable**. Without the constant renewal of these two power elements, he would absolutely be disposed of in what would amount as a military coup, with a side-dish of civil war that would be neutered and irrelevant due to a completely powerless general population:

* *Fear-based hierarchy*: Kim is one man surrounded by hundreds of subordinates operating a political machinery that predates him by two generations. His only legitimacy is generational and this isn't enough to convince the more technocratic-minded of his subordinates to follow him if they're not convinced of his strategic/leadership/military/nation-building ability. As a result, Kim must constantly *renew* a fear-based motive to keep the hierarchy in check with him as the top. He simply cannot afford to go for a prolonged period without, for example, carrying out ""purges"", the random public execution of high-ranking party elders that are perceived as some remote threat. The fact that these purges target elders reinforces that nobody in the hierarchy is safe from Kim's wrath (including [his own uncle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jang_Sung-taek)), and their graphical nature (including [execution via mortar round](http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2012/03/22/2012032200933.html)) helps crystallize a sensual human fear in people who hear the story and participate in the act. **Kim does not perform these purges because he's evil and angry: he does them strictly out of utility.** Doing these purges is equivalent to mowing a lawn or brushing his teeth: necessary maintenance to prevent the fermentation of a complicated problem. Make no mistake: if Kim goes for a couple of years without reinforcing this rule by fear, he will allow for an organized opposition to ferment on an intellectual level. This strategy also reinforces that the *only* path to personal comfort is complete loyalty to Kim, which is always rewarded and the opposite of which is always terribly punished.

* *Otherization*: The establishment and constant rejuvenation of a fear-based hierarchy keeps the party in check but doesn't do much to affect the loyalty of the general population. This is why Kim has to *constantly keep upping the ante* of his aggression against an ""otherized"" entity, in this case the United States and its ""pet poodle"" South Korea. The ""other"" is an entity that can never be reasoned with because it does not accept reason and that seeks your destruction because of its limitless depravity and ill faith. The threat of apocalyptic war against an infinitely malicious devil keeps the population in check and is exactly why Kim keeps making announcements, each very slightly bolder than the last, about the readiness and capability of his nuclear arsenal, about his very high willingness to invade South Korea at any moment, and so on. Kim has absolutely no interest in ever bombing the United States or even South Korea. This is all simply a survival mechanism that points to a created enemy, directs all negative attention towards it, freeing him to portray himself as the strong leader/hero/savior in whom complete trust is necessary for the people's survival.

Incidentally, otherization is something you'll find everywhere. It dates back hundreds of thousands of years in terms of human evolution and is a fundamental psychology in the survival of tribes. Sadly, it's deeply embedded in the recesses of our brain's architecture. It is exactly the psychology employed by ISIS to motivate attacks against the United States, but can also be seen manifesting itself in situations far less serious, for example Bernie Sanders voters vs. Trump voters, Snowden vs. NSA, Apple fans versus Android diehards... The goal is always to completely strangle and kill the intellectual capacity for nuance. Watch out for [thought-terminating clichés](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clich%C3%A9#Thought-terminating_clich.C3.A9) in your own daily life -- one of the surest indicators of otherization taking place."
What discredited hypotheses or theories do you nevertheless find appealing?,"Physics has a bunch:

* [The Georgi–Glashow model (SU(5) unification)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgi%E2%80%93Glashow_model) combines all the atomic forces together and unifies quarks (the building blocks of protons and neutrons) and leptons (electrons, neutrinos,...) into a single particle. That sounds simple, but the math turns out to work out surprisingly well. The problem is that by mixing forcles together like this the theory predicts that protons could decay into smaller particles, but [when we looked for those none were ever found.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_decay#Experimental_evidence) 

* [The WIMP miracle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakly_interacting_massive_particles): It turns out dark matter can be modeled really well if we think of it as a **W**eakly **I**nteracting **M**assive **P**article that has very 'normal' properties (weak interaction, 100 GeV mass). We had pretty good reason to suspect such a particle to exist because of supersymmetry (another one for this list perhaps), but if it exists in the cleanest form we should have seen it in the LHC by now. 

* On the flipside of this it's also possible to model dark matter as (among other exotic options) stray black holes which were formed in the chaos of the big bang: [**Ma**ssive **C**ompact **H**alo **O**bjects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_compact_halo_object).  Again, we looked for these (if one passes by it would deflect starlight around it), but even if they exist, not nearly enough seem to be around for them to explain all the dark matter.

* [Kaluza Klein Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaluza%E2%80%93Klein_theory) shows that if you start with an ordinary, empty 4 dimensional spacetime and add a fifth, very tiny, rolled up dimension you get all the equations of electromagnetism for free. Unfortunately it turns out that fifth dimension is extremely unstable and would explode in size so we would see it. Different, far more complicated versions of this idea still show up in string theory though. 

* These types of theories have always been my favourites: Lord Kelvin had a theory in 1860 that different atoms were actually vortices in the aether flowing in different [knotted shapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory). Sort of similarly, there is the idea of [geons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geon_\(physics\)): a gravitational wave that is held together by the gravity of its own energy. There was some initial hope that these kinds of structures could act as the fundamental particles, although I don't think anyone serious is working on this now."
"If the current “trade war” persisted, how likely would it lead the US to another Great Depression? If so, what can we do to be prepared for it?","As unsatisfying as it is to say, the real answer is probably “it’s tough to say.”  Even making the assumption that the current trade war persisted is not enough make predictions about what will happen- if the tariffs as currently proposed were to remain as is then realistically we probably aren’t looking at another recessionary trigger. The scary thing about trade wars though is that by their very nature they tend to escalate - tit for tat responses can very quickly lead to more and more tariffs and the erection of large barriers to international trade will have an adverse effect on the US economy. Part of the scary thing about wars of all types is that it’s tough to predict how they end.

The other tough thing about free trade and it’s intersection with politics is that while free trade is clearly good for the country as a whole and the majority of the population it is bad for some individuals. We’re in an unprecedented period of economic growth, but your brothers cousins aunt may have lost their job as a result and that is undeniably tough on that family. Politics and coverage in America today though thrives on anecdotes because they play well. It’s easier to rally voters with the story of your brothers cousins aunt than a several basis point move in GDP. Politics today also tends to be reactionary talking about things that have happened to rally support for things that could happen. By the numbers the most common job in America today is truck driver and the average long haul truck driver salary is 71k. These are the new skill based jobs that can support a middle class lifestyle.  In large part these job le are the result of NAFTA. Killing these jobs in the hopes of trying to bring back steel production jobs (which aren’t coming back except in a highly automated way) could have disasterous consequences for the economy. This is just one example of how many factors are in play."

Can anyone explain to me why exactly everybody likes the Dalai Lama? What exactly has he done that everybody seems to respect him?,"[This](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8521957.stm) article might answer a few questions. The gist of the article from what I can see is that his personality attributes are essentially what makes him popular, namely:

* being the underdog removed from his home
* being cheerful, but more importantly, looking cheerful
* supports religious secularism, doesn't proselytize
* is accepting of science, and is willing to change his beliefs

These attributes combined make him likeable, non-threatening, and makes him spiritually appealing, without threatening a persons established beliefs. The religious can like him because they won't be directly persuaded to convert to buddhism. Secularists and atheists like him because he marginally changes his beliefs based on science. Politicians like him because it serves as a political punch to China, and a political boon at home amongst his admirers."

"Redditors who spent years as NEETs (young adults without jobs, education or training), how'd you get out and what are you doing now?","Was 18 years old in 2011, and spent 2 years after high school looking for work half-heartedly after the education system convinced me I never wanted to learn a damn thing again. Spent this time receiving Jobseeker's Allowance (our UK unemployment net) and living with my mother, drinking constantly and being very, very depressed and angry. Felt like there was no place in the world for me and I'd be unemployed and useless forever. 

At a doctor's visit once I got very frustrated with some doctor's complete disregard for mental health problems and how they could affect physical health. It was like they were literally deaf to any mention of stress or anxiety having an effect on health. It was infuriating but what did I know? I was just a dumb unemployed (20 year old) kid. It felt so powerless and wrong that I could do nothing, so I decided I wanted to be a mental health researcher. I had many more issues than just this one, but it tipped it for me. And why not? It was obvious I was completely unfit for any commercial sector work. 

After learning I had quite severe ADHD during my first year of bachelor's study, I got meds for it, and managed to do better than I ever have at anything. University education is nothing like the UK's A levels which are our equivalent of SATs, and I found I excelled at it when I actually cared about what I was studying. 

I'm 24 now, and will be starting a fully funded PhD this year at a top institution, which will allow me to live independently after maybe a year of saving. Still living with my mother at 24, but so are most people my age where I live, and I'm just happy things are finally looking up, and am regularly amazed at how far I got in four years, from such hopeless beginnings."

Which jobs deserve to be paid minimum wage?,"Servers, cashier, and janitors are in that category, however the issue is the living wage amount.

Is it morally wrong to look at a naked neighbour?,"Why did you glance away if he turned his face toward the window?

It seems there is more than one dimension to this example: one, the act of being an unseen watcher; and two, seeing someone naked. The first can be experienced as power. You see them but they don’t see you. The nakedness ups the ante — it’s something most people regard as private. So you are watching someone doing something private, apparently without their awareness. When they turn their face toward you, you look away.

Moral codes define boundaries that regulate our interactions to promote harmony and the greater good. When our natural individual impulses incline us to do one thing, an inner sense of propriety may prompt us to refrain. 

Control over the means of looking is an issue. Many have commented that your neighbour has the power to close his curtains and yet chooses not to. Or does he? It is easy not to be aware. He may have chosen to open his curtains at one time but forgotten to close them later on. 

What do we know? Your respective genders (he’s male, you’re female), your relationship (neighbours), the act (you looking), his state (naked). 

What don’t we know? We don’t know if he is conscious of his visibility in the moment. We don’t know if he is comfortable with being seen naked by you.  

Given that uncertainty, your inner prompting to look away when he might see you looking, and your boyfriend’s concerns, seem valid.

So I’d say, it’s not wrong to notice, but it is wrong to watch."

Why Don't We Indent Paragraphs Online?,"I'm a very old person who was involved with the Web back when the first standards document came out.  I will give you the technical history of it.  HTML 1, back when the Web was initiated, didn't really have a ""standards document.""  People at CERN and other huge organizations just called Tim Berners-Lee and asked what formatting commands they could use, and then did it.  He once said in an interview that he had a floppy disk with a list of formatting commands on it, and he just used sneaker-net to distribute it.  However, HTML 2 quickly followed, and *was* a standard.  So, we can look at it:

http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1866.txt

That super old document is from back in 1994 & 1995, as the Web was creeping into popular awareness.  You can see a few important quotes from it.  For example:

> Typically, paragraphs are surrounded by a vertical space of one line or half a line. The first line in a paragraph is indented in some cases.

So the people making the Web happen suggested that paragraphs have vertical space, and *maaayybe* an indent.  People following the standard implemented the must-haves and left out the optionals.  Also, this gem is from the same document:

> Documents should not contain tab characters, as they are not supported consistently.

Now, that comment has to do with preformatted text (think blocks of code), but it nonetheless reflects a thinking that is affecting us still today.  Back then, we didn't have a glorious, universal character set for the Web (UTF-8).  So something written on a Mac would look like crap on a Windows computer, and both would be a mess on a Unix/Linux computer.  And something from Japan would be unreadable on a US computer.  Nothing was interchangeable, everything broke.  So the Web guys basically said ""Screw it, anything that isn't A-Z or 0-9 is OUT.""  Tabs were not popular due to wonkiness.  That's an oversimplification, but if I want to stop typing anytime soon, it'll have to do.  :)

Other factors came into play quickly.  Forms were invented -- yes, invented; they didn't exist at first on the Web and were a revelation -- and tabbing from field to field was normal.  In addition, HTML was based upon SGML, and whitespace is designated to collapse in such specifications.  What this means is that if you put 2 spaces after a period, which I do, as all old people do, then the rules for the Web say ""collapse that down to 1.""  My 2 spaces are there, in the code under the Web page, but the *display* of my writing is different: everything is single spaces everywhere.  Same is *supposed* to go for tabs, carriage returns (new lines), and anything else that is white space.  If you put in a bunch of white space, it's supposed to collapse down to almost nothing.

So you have a bunch of people who got used to tab as a key to move through forms rather than a key to indent (and trying to submit text with a tab IN it is still difficult to this day), and you have tabs getting collapsed down to almost no space at all anyway thanks to the standards documents insisting it be so.  Because of this, we were almost forced to use carriage returns, as it was one of the only visually distinct ways to break up a document (and even that isn't truly reliable; don't get me started on the Windows/Mac/Linux differences in new lines and carriage returns).  It's a historical leftover and nobody has to follow it anymore, but just like roads being a set width thanks to wagons in ancient Rome, we follow it anyway.

**tl;dr** When we see a pretty Web page, underneath it's actually a super-ugly jumble of formatting codes that have a history of not respecting white space, and therefore the only ""big"" way to insert some visible organization was a carriage return."
Received an Amber Alert notification on my cell phone last night. Is this system good or bad?,"It comes through the cell towers, so it is geographic.  It is a good system.  Besides the cellphones, I also see it appear on things like those digital signs that stores have or even traffic construction signs.  Down here in Florida, we also have something called Silver alerts for elderly people with dementia who wander off.

It puts a lot of eyes on the lookout for a person.  There may be some kidnappers who would be desperate, but there is the chance that someone would be able to report something that saves someone before it happens.

A lot of kidnappings aren't people attacking children, but custody disputes, and amber alerts are good for locating the getaway cars.

Why do and how do people develop musical preferences?,"There’s a wonderful book called “this is your brain on music” by Daniel J Levitin. He says that your brain is making connections about the world around it- knowing the difference between cold and hot, high and low, red and blue- from birth till around jr. high when the brain looses some of Its elasticity. So the environment that people grow up in will have a big impact on what it thinks is “good music”. This is why Asian cultures appreciate a different scale and ideas of what is pleasing voice tone (Peking opera for instance). African cultures have a really complex rhythm system (using crazy time signatures like 12/8 and compound meters). The children grow up in those different musical systems and their brains become hard wired to like that style of music. 

(Interestingly, while meter and scale can vary wildly in different cultures, almost every culture operates with the octave - because mathematically, its a doubling of the frequency). 

So if you ask most people what is their favorite music (“what is the music of you heart”) many times they will identify music that was popular when they were in Jr High.  This isn’t to say that bo brains have no elasticity past jr high, but that the music we listen to up to that point really informed our brains as to what is “good music”.

So for those parents out there, one of the best things you can do is expose your kids to lots of different music styles. 

The challenge is that 200-300 years ago, music didn’t change that quickly. You had folk/tavern music (think of what you would sing around a campfire or in a tavern) and you had “high music” (think of classical music).  So people would have all appreciated very similar styles to one another. This would have greatly contributed to sociological cohesion and identity. But now with the rapid transfer of information, music styles change not even every generation, but even several times in one generation. So musical subcultures are more refined and specialized.  

While the variety of musical expressions is a good thing, I think we’ve lost how music can hold us together socially. "
Which jobs will never be replaced by machines?,"I think jobs where people need a human-human connection are fundamentally irreplaceable at the hand of machines. Jobs such as school counselors, marriage counselors, clinical psychologists, religious figures, human resources, social workers, parole officers, and many others where we just need someone to listen, someone to talk to, and someone who genuinely cares. 

No matter how human-like AI becomes - when we need a shoulder to cry on, we want compassion not code."
"To any redditors who have spent time in prison, what are prisoners' attitudes on the guilt or innocence of other prisoners?

I told my story online and was ridiculed and called a liar. Nobody believed me. That leads me to think that the other prisoners just support each others claims for solidarity.

"Where and how did the now infamous ""Every child gets a trophy"" mentality start?","It was, like pretty much every other style of parenting since the Victorian era, thought to be the best way to rear a child at the time.  

Sometime during the Victorian era, roundabout the time that child labour laws started to be A Thing, people also realized that children weren't merely stupid miniature adults, but were cognitively and developmentally different and needed different treatment to produce better adults down the road.  

Notions that childhood events could affect the adult you'd end up being were absolutely new at the time.  Quite simply, some people took it for granted, others never thought about it, but no one had sat down and said ""children in X conditions in their childhood end up being Y kind of adults"" ... lots of these were absolutely wrong, to be sure, but the ideas were headed in the right direction.  

Ever since then, there's been whole waves and surges and fads of ways to raise children, each purporting to be better than others and each with its own advantages and pitfalls.  Most of these came about as a reaction to the style of parenting the current generation of parents were raised in.  

From here on in we get sweeping generalization-y.  No one person or upbringing embodies all of the traits I'm running through, but this is a colesnotes summary of general trends.  

The idea behind ""every child is special"" was a reaction to the environment that our parents were raised in, notably one where achieving tangible results and making pragmatic sacrifices was paramount.  They were raised to pursue ""solid"" careers, praised when they won awards, and chastised when they didn't win awards.  They were raised conformist, competitive, and to a black-and-white morality.  Ambition was encouraged in moderation, but inappropriate in quantity - aspiring for a promotion was good, but aspiring to take your boss' job was bad.  Concepts of class and station were tacitly encouraged, and many households had an almost militaristic discipline, as most parents of the era had lived through one or both world wars, and their values and the culture of the time were strongly shaped by those events.  

Our parents might have thrived in this environment had society sat still and remained fairly static following the wars.  Instead, the 60's happened.  Kids brought up in rigid formal conformist environments were tossed into North America's own cultural revolution: civil rights, feminism, the anti-war movement were all in full swing as our folks grew up.  

In the course of that, the ideals they'd been raised with were thrown into question - is that ""good"" but unfulfilling job *really* what you should be wanting or aspiring to?  Is having slightly nicer stuff than your suburban neighbors really the best metric of success available?  Why not follow your passions, and live content with whatever that pays you?  Because of the economic boom occurring at the time, it was possible for people to make a living doing all sort of things that the older generation wouldn't have considered a ""real job.""  But fundamentally, it was very apparent to our parents that the measures of success they'd been taught produced financially successful but ""spiritually"" miserable adults, both by observing their parents and their peers.  

So they resolved not to repeat the ""mistakes"" of their parents.  

...Instead, teaching their kids that they were special no matter what they chose to do as a job, that sometimes winning isn't actually all that matters, and that sometimes doing something because it's fun is as good a reason as you need.  

They praised us when we won, because winning is still winning.  But they praised us when we lost, because we'd still gone out and tried, and they praised us when everything went wrong because they wanted us to keep trying and to understand that sometimes you gotta keep losing to ever have a shot at winning.  

They understood that we're not all born equal, that some kids are bigger, faster, stronger, or otherwise advantaged, and other kids are similarly disadvantaged; they taught us to recognize both in ourselves and to focus on our strengths rather than mourning our weaknesses.  But they also taught us that just because we're outmatched is no cause to forfeit: simply trying is praiseworthy in and of itself.  "

Is there some economic or political motivation behind the anti-vaccination movement?,"It started as general distrust of government and authority. Our flaw of viewing rich people as automatically smart has only fueled the movement, because there is no doubt that they made it worse. Rich and famous people looking for yet another way to take advantage of stupid people have had a field day with this distrust and misinformation. The wild conspiracies surrounding alternative medicine, healing auras, essential oils... you name it. There is tons of money to be made in this. And if you can get on the radio or a 10 am talk show with someone who has reach and influence (for example Oprah) then you can make sure that whatever you say wont even be questioned until years after the fact. The “marketplace of ideas” doesnt mean much when people just bounce around from promoted bad idea to promoted bad idea and the good ideas are just lost in the noise. 

The movement has inherently ingrained bias against anyone that speaks poorly of it. If Google only has results showing vaccines are ok then the reaction is “CENSORSHIP!!!” If a radio show personality talks how vaccines work they have “been paid off by someone” and this someone is usually “big pharma” or whatever.

Others have already said this too but the image that someone else is responsible for things instead of bad luck, genetics, or themselves is also a big driver of all this

Is it possible to be 'not so feminine' without people thinking you're gay?,"Honestly, I’d say there are always going to be people who are confused/uncomfortable with anything less explicitly gendered than a stereotype. Even then, you’ll have to meet *their* standard of what that looks like, and that’s ridiculous.

Now if you’re talking present-day USA, then no, it’s not really unusual anymore, in the broadest sense. Generally, short hair/jeans/minimal makeup aren’t going to cause hawking en masse.

That being said, it’s definitely going to depend in part on where you are, the sort of people you run into, and how closely you cleave to the norm—both in appearance and in personality; e.g., having a personality which rejects gender roles in San Francisco won’t get anyone to bat an eye at you, but it might get some whispered gossip (and worse) in other parts of the country. Likewise for more gender-neutral/androgynous personality traits—there are absolutely still those out there who 100% believe a woman should live to serve her man, while having no independence/autonomy of her own, just as there are those who don’t have two fucks to give about those kinds of roles.

And that’s just the abridged America!"
Why is Russia poisoning a double agent such a big deal?,"1. These people were *former* spies - traded and released. Russia shouldn't have any need to meddle with them. It was unwarranted aggression on foreign soil. 

2. They used nerve agent in a civilian area, putting many at risk. Nerve agent is a war crime on its own, let alone when I'm use near civilians.

I'm sure there are more reasons, but that's what I think. I don't think this should be taken lightly. "
Do you believe humans are the only animal to ponder death?,"I used to have pet rats. One of them got sick and eventually passed away. One of his better rat friends was with him when he died and a little after. After, the friend would visit the dead guy's old hangout spots and just kind of sit by himself. Before, though, he never hung out in those places.

I think all mammals, and perhaps other animals (especially birds), have thoughts about death. Obviously, the complexity and sophistication of those thoughts varies with their intelligence, but I think those thoughts certainly exist.

It seems likely that the other great apes think of death much like we do. I believe it's a fully-formed concept for any ape that has experienced it. An older chimp who gets injured, for instance, probably contemplates his likely imminent death. While he doesn't think in sentences like ""I hope the community manages to get enough bananas to feed itself even after I'm gone,"" I suspect the chimp has sufficient imagination and emotion to more or less go through the same process. Similarly, I think apes whose parents (especially mothers) die go through significant grief, and even years after the death they probably spend time remembering the deceased and try to imagine them being alive.

Do they have anything like an afterlife concept? Maybe. Maybe humans' notion of the afterlife only exists because we communicate and record what we like to imagine our dead loved ones would be doing if they were still around. E.G., ""Grandpa is just chilling out on a fluffy cloud, eating grapes and listening to harp music."" Write down that daydream for a few centuries and suddenly you have religious belief in Heaven. Maybe other animals have the same kind of recollective imagination, but it just doesn't ""mature"" into religious belief since they can't fully express the concept to each other."
What exactly did people think was going on at the NSA prior to the leaks?,"I think most people had an inkling that they were being spied on in one manner or another.

They'd pretty casually say, ""oh yeah, we listen to everything, even skype!"" 

It seems doubtful that anyone who was aware of the Patriot Act or had seen the X-Files would be totally taken aback by the premise of government spying.  Really it's just the public confirmation that's so breathtaking.

We were all in a state of denial in a way, but one where we had our suspicions. 

Sort of like having your boyfriend/girlfriend act suspicious for a few weeks and then getting a text from a mutual acquaintance that they've been cheating on you. The writing was on the wall, but as long as there was no evidence or admission you were in a quasi-comfortable state of self-enacted ignorance. One that you were almost happier inside of.

"People who have moved from welfare class to middle or higher - How did you do it, what skills did you need to learn, and what is it like transitioning up the social ladder?","I grew up poor.  Like a can of Spam for dinner for the whole family-poor.  We were on public assistance for a while, but so was everyone else in our town.

I joined the military, and really learned how to manage money - it started of course, with a stable job, and a lot of expenses paid for: medical care, housing, food, etc.

I started early, IRAs, savings accounts, bought a house in my mid 20s, which is now being rented out, as I moved away on orders.

I basically just learned from my past.  How to make every dollar count.  How to save up and buy things with cash.  Yeah, I have credit cards, but rarely use them.  I also learned to not be wasteful.  Buy products that last (and maintain them properly), and buy and cook food at home vice going out to eat.

I gotta say, I'm approaching 40 with two kids, and it's getting more and more difficult as they get older.  I can buy them whatever they want, and I don't want to say no.  I have to balance the desire to give them a better life than I had, without spoiling them.  So, I make them earn money by doing chores, and they pay for their own toys when we go out shopping.  Birthdays and Holidays are light-years better than mine, but we try to stay reasonable with purchases.

So, we are definitely 'well off' financially, but don't do the fine-dining bit, or drive around in luxury cars.  Being in the military, our circle of friends are people just like us.

When I do retire, I will likely be a millionaire, but as my financial advisor told me 20 years ago, the number one vehicle of choice for American millionaires is the Ford F-150.  Because those who work hard at it, tend to want to keep it.

Obviously these things are specific to me, but if there's things on the list you haven't done, I'd suggest trying them.

The biggest thing I've learned, though is life is what you make it, and your attitude towards things has a huge effect on how they turn out. The biggest blow against my depression was changing the story I told myself. I told myself I was weird, ugly and not very good at making friends. Then, I'd look at old pictures and I was always better looking and more social than I remembered being. So I decided to change the story I tell myself. It has been a long journey, but after about 6 years, I can finally say I'm on the right track. I still have bad days now and then, but I feel like a completely different person from when I wanted to kill myself"
"How do provably false misconceptions (like the anti-vaxx movement, for example) become so widespread and what can we do, societally or legislatively, to counteract them?","I think the rise of the internet has ironically contributed to the ""false consensus effect"" where instead of people being critical of beliefs due to unsupporting evidence, internet forums allow people with various false beliefs to congregate and become more ignorant."
Why does the USA not have a gun license in the vein of Driver's Licences?,"Obviously I can't speak for everyone, but this is what I see and hear from my circle of friends and family. And just for full disclosure, I do own a gun - a .22 single shot. Fire, reload, fire, reload, that I use for target shooting occasionally. I live in a region that is filled with hunters - deer, turkey, squirrel, rifle, black powder, bow, etc - so I like to think I hear a lot of the arguments being made against licensing or a registry. 

First off, many gun owners aren't opposed to licensing. They do agree that it would be a pain for them, a ""fix"" that wouldn't really fix anything. The accidents you mention happen to a percentage of a percentage of gun owners in the US - that's how many guns there are. However, they agree - and this is the camp I'm personally in - that there are just some people out there who should not be allowed to own guns. I'm sure everyone knows someone they'd be terrified of if that person owned a gun. Now, how to go about deciding who those people are is a totally different story, and I won't get into it right now - I'll only speak to the licensing bits. 

One argument against licensing is that it could then be used to create a registry - that someone, somewhere in the US Gov't would know who owns every (legally purchased) gun in the US. And if the time came that the gov't decided people shouldn't have guns, this would make it that much easier for them to track them down and take them. 

It may seem far-fetched, but there were reports post-Katrina of police and National Guard units confiscating guns from people who, last I heard, never got them back. Again, I know this is a rare circumstance, there was looting, people weren't safe - I'm aware.

And then there is the bit in the Constitution: A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.

This was written in the times that everyone had guns because you couldn't go down to the local Publix and buy a pound of hamburger. It was written at a time when you couldn't pull a trigger and spray off 40 rounds a second. It was written at a time when the US didn't have a standing army - it was entirely made up of volunteers who had their own weapons, and they were ""well regulated"" in the sense that they were organized by state and then divisions. This wasn't the same type of militia that's causing the scene in Oregon at the moment. 

Now, I'm not saying most gun owners who are anti-registry are beer-swilling, pickup-driving, white-hood wearing militia types. They're clearly not - again, these are a very, very small percentage of gun owners. But that is one of the arguments. 

Some people are anti-registry because they feel that the background checks would be too invasive. As of now (in most states - this may vary), when you buy a gun you are asked to fill out a form. That form asks if you've ever been committed to a mental institution or have committed a felony. I don't know the exact wording, so don't quote me on those, but that's what it's asking for. As of right now, if you see a therapist/doctor/psychiatrist/psychologist/whoever that thinks you shouldn't own a gun because you're a danger to yourself or others, they can only go to the police, and that's only if they think someone is in immediate danger. (Again, this may vary from state-to-state.) One of the proposed changes is that mental health issues, domestic violence charges/convictions, etc are added to background checks. Some people claim that just because they got in a fight with their wife 15 years ago and she got a restraining order, now they'll never be able to own a gun. Because they work in a call center and are depressed as hell because they work 50 hours a week and still barely get by, they're prescribed Zoloft or Prozac, and that may keep them from being able to own a gun. 

The arguments on that are something that would have to be looked into very deeply. Mental illness still carries such a stigma in this country that a lot of people don't want to admit to having it in the first place, much less have others know about it who can block their ""right"" to own a gun. (I put right in quotes to begin with, but that looks like I'm being a smug asshole, and I'm really not.)

Others are okay with the background checks as long as they're instant. These checks are currently carried out by licensed dealers, not by individual sellers (this is the gun-show loophole). Some argue that the loophole is not a loophole because it's not circumventing the law. Either way, people can sell guns to other people without having to do a background check. One of the proposed solutions would be to open background checks to everyone who was selling a weapon, but then you have anyone at all who can access background checks. So they need to be licensed dealers. Well, that won't work because when you go to gun shows there's not always a phone connection, an internet connection or whatever to run the background check. 

And again, these checks have to be instant to be accepted (by some). As of right now (again, state-to-state applies, I think), to buy a handgun in my state you have to fill out an application for the background check, then wait three days. Well, the FBI (I think is who does them - if not, correct me) has a finite number of people who they can put into the background check position. Once they're busy, they're busy - others stack up. If you apply for the handgun and your background check isn't back in three days, they can still sell you the weapon. So instant background checks would be literally almost impossible - without a registry, which brings us back to the other argument. 

When I was in school many moons ago, we actually had firearm safety class. You had to complete it before you could get a hunting license. This clearly didn't stop anyone from not practicing gun safety, but it's a start. Most states that issue concealed carry permits require several hours of classroom training, and there are gun clubs all over the country who I'm sure would love to give safety classes. The more people know about guns, the less they become scared of them. Not that they don't respect them - I don't mean that they shouldn't be careful with them, just that they won't have a heart attack if they're in a restaurant and some guy happens to be carrying. The media doesn't help by labeling things as assault rifles and tactical this and that.

So that's what I get from my friends and family. I can see some points on both sides of all the arguments, so I don't really get into them. If someone starts the gun argument at a family gathering, I just head to the kitchen to get more food. 

Hope this gives you some information you may not have had!

"Once all production is done by machines, could communism actually work?","Apparently this was Marx's original vision for Communism. If you've ever read any of Iain M. Banks' science fiction novels, Marx's ""Grundrisse"" was part of his inspiration for The Culture.

The polymath Richard Buckminster Fuller envisaged a similar future once what he called ""technology of super-abundance"" had been achieved.

Prior to industrialisation, large parts of Britain were classed as ""common"" or ""waste"" ground, unowned by anyone. They were typically used by landless peasants for subsistence farming. A key part of the origin of modern capitalism can be found in the enclosure acts in the UK, which gave the property rights of this land to wealthy private owners. Although there were enclosures previously, the process accelerated significantly in the late 18th century. A large part of the motivation for this, which the British ruling class discussed quite openly, was to drive the peasants off the land and into the factories, creating a class of dependant ""wage slaves"" who had no choice, but to sell their labour in order to survive. (Note, the British rulers didn't use the term ""wage slave"", but they were unabashed about their goal of creating dependence.)

Clearly mechanisation holds the promise of reversing this shift, allowing individuals to support themselves outside of capitalism. However, as others in this thread have noted, a huge amount of scarcity in our modern world is largely the result of political decisions, rather than technical lack, and any communist society would require substantial redistribution of land and capital.

Given the leaked information on the Intellectual Property section of the Trans Pacific Partnership(TPP), it seems the Plutocracy is determined to maintain a system of power through scarcity, even if it has to create scarcity in the super-abundance of information.

**tl;dr** Yes, but only if greedy people don't fuck it up with bad politics."
"Has anyone else gone from ""the 1%"" to ""the 99%"" as a result of the housing market crash and recession? How did you adjust and what did you learn?","I was doing well , maybe not the 1% but 20% any way. I started building a house. The bank asked me to get going with my own money or other forms of credit. It was on farm land so it had something to do with the home to land value. So I get about half way in and call the bank. They say the money is on its way to cover the part that I have done so far. 5 days later they call to say they went bankrupt. Leaving me with all the debt. My investments were leveraged with margin loans and those were called. Leaving me penniless and in debt up to my eyeballs. Also at this time my business revenue dropped by 70% . Everything I make goes to paying debt and I can barely cloth my family now. Oh 2008,  how I wish ye had never happened.
Edit: I haven't adjusted yet. Just live with every day uncertainty as to weather my family farm will be taken away in about 6 months when a huge loan comes do. I learned that good people making seemingly good decisions can get screwed through no fault of their own. I mean , who heard of banks going bankrupt on a regular basis before 2008.  "
"What is the biggest decision you have made that does not directly influence your life, but instead someone else's.","Any time I've extended a job offer to someone who lives in a different part of the country/world I think about how much things are changing for them. On my end, I chose them because they were the best candidate for the job but even the best is only marginally better than the second best so it doesn't affect me too much. However, If they are leaving all of their friends and family to start fresh, that's a pretty big deal. "
"What do you think it says about humanity that Bill Gates and Warren Buffett are exceptions among billionaires, for their charitable contributions?","[As of this month, 113 Billionaires have signed Gates and Buffett's ""Giving Pledge""]( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Giving_Pledge). And it's not a bunch of anonymous ones either... Elon Musk, Reed Hastings, Richard Branson, even Barry Diller... They comprise roughly 10% of billionaires by number... I don't have the time to do the math, but the vast fortunes of some of the people on the list, I wouldn't be surprised if a majority of the total wealth of billionaires was represented.  Gates and Buffett have publicists who have the job of representing clients who are household names as ""world's richest man"", so we hear a lot about them. But that doesn't mean the people whose names don't grab pageviews are just sitting on their islands being fed grapes."
"Do you believe that groups like ""Anonymous"" have the ability to bring about major changes in society?","I think Anonymous might be less of a creator of social change than a symptom of the unfulfilled desire for social change. People feel powerless in the face of injustice and apathy and wish for or wish to be part in a powerful and ideal-driven entity that can fight back. This may also explain the current popularity of super hero movies. Of course, this is just armchair psychology. But there might be something to it still."
Lets have a balanced discussion about the protests in turkey.,"A big part of the problem, for me, is that I really don't know what to believe. There is so much propaganda and *dis*information these days, from various sources, that it's hard to ever get a clear picture of what's going on. Since I'm not able to form an informed opinion, I abstain from having one...as much as this is possible. 

For example, when I see a picture of an injured protester (these pictures are put out to gain sympathy for the protestors -- I mean that to be value-neutral), how can I reach a conclusion about what happened before that person was injured. Was he attacking the police, attacking a protestor, is he even in Turkey and involved in the protests at all? I simply don't know. 

Granted, this information may be available, but I haven't taken the time to research it, see the issue/pictures/videos from all sides, and THEN form an opinion. And I say this while being wary of painting with a too-wide brush, but I don't think many *Reddit users* have either.

(Thinking about my answer, it seems to be a bit off-topic and about much larger themes in general, but if the mods/readers don't mind it, I think I'll leave it in hopes of generating a side discussion.)"
"With a felony on my record, I cannot for the life of me get a job. What am I supposed to do? Steal cars for a living?","My dad's a felon and he has an awesome job. He's a finance manager at a car dealership. It was hard for him, especially because he was in a halfway house with no car or phone for 6 months after prison, when he was looking for work, but he worked it out and got a job relatively quickly (within weeks of leaving prison). He had experience, but no formal training in anything -- only a high school diploma. He told potential job offers his background instead of trying to hide it and though it lost him plenty of interviews, there were people who said they just didn't care -- it was about how well he could do the job. Honestly, he spent every minute of his days looking for work and it paid off. 

So maybe try a car dealership. In my dad's experience, people there just don't care as much as elsewhere if you have a record."
"How would civilization look different if the average human's natural ""sober"" state was one of heroin-like bliss?","Former addict here. We would eventually all die. Human beings were designed by evolution in a kind of haphazard, but ultimately really clever way. On average, our brains are built so that when we do something constructive to daily life as a human being (eating, sex, fostering relationships, working, seeking novelty, creating, solving problems, being mindful, thinking) we get some kind of reward, as mediated by neurochemicals and brain networks. Through a fluke of plant-human coevolution, we can bypass that. As in we can just snort the happy into our blood. That ultimately makes it so that we can't even be real, individual human beings with basically functioning internal lives, let alone capable of maintaining civilization. Ironically, by making everyone's inner world into a personal heaven, you would transform the planet into a living hell. "
"Why do people continue to put time, effort and energy into earning money (at the expense of other dimensions of life they claim to care about) even after they have more than they could ever spend in a lifetime?","In that famous commencement speech, David Foster Wallace talks about how everyone is worshipping something, whether it's a religion, money, beauty, or intellect. 

>Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship. And the compelling reason for maybe choosing some sort of god or spiritual-type thing to worship -- be it JC or Allah, bet it YHWH or the Wiccan Mother Goddess, or the Four Noble Truths, or some inviolable set of ethical principles -- is that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive. If you worship money and things, if they are where you tap real meaning in life, then you will never have enough, never feel you have enough. It's the truth. Worship your body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly. And when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they finally grieve you. On one level, we all know this stuff already. It's been codified as myths, proverbs, clichés, epigrams, parables; the skeleton of every great story. The whole trick is keeping the truth up front in daily consciousness.

>Worship power, you will end up feeling weak and afraid, and you will need ever more power over others to numb you to your own fear. Worship your intellect, being seen as smart, you will end up feeling stupid, a fraud, always on the verge of being found out. But the insidious thing about these forms of worship is not that they're evil or sinful, it's that they're unconscious. They are default settings.

Worth reading/listening to. I certainly buy into it.

Is the proposed border wall a red herring? Why shouldn't we equally turn our focus to the many American employers who are willing to accept illegal immigrant labor?,"From the ""Great Wall of China"" to the ""Iron Curtain"" these things have been a huge drain on  resources and have never worked. One of the last things we need right now is a trade war with Mexico. 

If we get rid of the Mexicans who will do the work they do? If your answer is domestic labor then how much more are you willing to pay for your basic needs? Anyone willing to work 4am to 8am and 4pm to 8pm seven days a week on a dairy farm for minimum wage with no benefits? 

The most likely results will we send the Mexicans back and import the products they make in Mexico rather than letting them work here. If you like being dependent on  imported oil, you will love being dependent on imported food. "
Why is the N-word derogatory but not self deprecating?,"The best answer to this question I said to a friend is this.

So you make friends with guys and through H.S. you do some very stupid stuff. This stuff bonds your friendship. Since you guys are kids, penis, fart, butt plug and douche comes out as endearing(joking) terms. Turn out your nickname becomes asswipe or dickwart( again only in your tight group of friends).

When they call you like that, you don't want your family, teachers, or some stranger across the street to call you dickwart. But you let it slide for your friends because you go wayyy back. 

Also you know that the nickname dickwart is always meant in a friendly way, your friends won't call you like that in the middle of an argument or to insult you.

You are with your friends having  some drinks and one of them goes, "" Guys remember when /r/Paragora did this hilariously stupid thing that got us all grounded/suspended for a couple a days? Man was that funny! Why did you think this would work? Danm dickwart, always trying to save a situation by making it worse! HAHAHA."" See how there is nothing wrong with it?

On an other day comes that one guy who you really don't know that well  and for some reason you are having an argument. Out of no where he calls you a fucking dickwart. You know he's not reffering to you like your close friends because he sure isn't and he keeps insulting you so things escalate. 

This is the same thing with the N-Word, the Dyke word, the Wops(IIRC and Italian who lost his roots), Gringo (IIRC a Brazilian without his roots or a tourist),  and other derogatory words in every culture. It's endearing in a group that is a minority but derogtory to those who didn't live in this culture.

I can garantee you that even among black folks, one stranger calling the other an ignorant n* doing N* shit will get the same result as any other person saying N*.

So to clear this out, it has a lot to do with the way the one being called n* perceives it. It is still an insulting word even coming from someone you know but friends and such you grew up with tend to get a pass on it **because they know not to use it in a way to hurt you**. 

To add to this, I can't say it's a black culture thing, it's with all cultures. A person with insecurities who grew up in a rather poor ghetto( be it a trailer park, an affordable housinf projet or any other ghetto type of concentration) will want to grow up to keep the good part of his culture but leave the bad part( like the stereotypes being said by the people of the race in power(Politicians CEO and such)) behind.  By calling them Trailer thrash, redneck, n*, Whop or whatever the word applies to his race, you are telling him that he is a regression, someone who is still living and acting like a poor bottom of the barrel no class immigrant instead of having gone up a couple of class higher( adapting to living in a new country is already a class higher).

So this will bring some insecurities in some and those are the one making the news for it.

For the many who do make the news for reacting violently, there are as many[who keep their calm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-QnUPvsK8o) 

TLDR: It's a bad word by default used in a good way by those around you. If you are looking to feel what it is like, just look in your culture what are the bad words that represents the bottom of the barell people but can be an endearment when used among your friends.

Edit: wow this blew up glad it helped! Thanks for the Midas Touch!"

How should you respond to homeless people/beggars?,"I live in an automobile-oriented city where homeless people often panhandle at intersections.  I always keep a stash of granola bars in my car to give out.  It's not much, but it's something and I'd much rather give food than cash. "
What would be the consequences if a new government leaker provided irrefutable proof that 9-11 was an inside job.,"I don't think it would hinge so much on whether the proof was irrefutable but whether a significant institution or group within the political elite chose to champion the cause and managed to fight their way through the inevitable avalanche of PR and massive campaign to undermine and delegitimize the evidence and anyone connected with it.

If that happened and popular opinion in the US was brought along there would inevitably be a shift in position by those responsible. Suddenly, all along they fully took responsibility but it was the only way to bring about the ends that the world and America so desperately needed; and they hated it but were forced into taking the hard decision for the good of freedom and democracy. In fact they were the reluctant heroes in this awful tragedy, living with this dark secret, this stain on their souls so that you innocents could live your lives in the light, free from the burdens of the real world. And now we attack them with the false morality of our childish naivety, how they suffer as we bite this fatherly hand that protects us? ... and anyway it was really (insert name here) who really was the one in the middle of the whole thing, as yes s/he did really go a bit far, got a bit carried away. Then we would all watch as (insert name here) committed seppukku to the tune of the self-righteous indignation of some kind of inquiry. (a la Oliver North with accompanying destruction of evidence and other assorted diversions and tomfoolery).

The government would then declare that the decay had been ruthlessly uprooted and destroyed and it was terrible and regrettable that something so horrendous had happened, our thoughts are with the families etc.

The UN would do whatever and the US would veto it as usual. Maybe some other bastion of international law would declare such and such and the US would ignore that too.

The result would be that it would be almost impossible for the US to manufacture consent for foreign aggression for a long time and it would be difficult for democratic allies to generate support in their own countries to internationally support the US in it's foreign expeditions. This might have already happened though.

The big question is how would the relationship between the government and the people change? In an environment where the elites can no longer rely on a monopoly on discourse would the population buy their story? Would that result in unrest and an increase in the police state, maybe to the point of the government completely throwing off the shackles of democracy? Would it result in populist politician siding with popular dissent and throwing the conspirators to the wolves? Would it result in a successful PR and astroturfing campaign that relegated dissent around the issue to fringe hardcore political nuts? does the government have to start resorting to dissappearing people they identify as nodes in the network of dissent ,given that they now have the whole internet on tape how hard would it be... even just shadowbanning them would be super-effective suddenly there's not really that much dissent any more, the whole thing seems to be blowing over... eh, how important was it anyway? We all knew they were bastards but what can you do? It looks like no-one else really cares that much and I have to go to work tomorrow.

"Why does genetic engineering elicit such a rabid and negative response in so many people? There seems to be an intentional culture of denial, misinformation and demonization surrounding the entire field of genetics. Why?","I wouldn't say I'm rabidly negative, but I am cautious around genetic tinkering. There's one big reason - The Law of Unintended Consequences. 

Too often we've seen scientific advances that, after some time, we learn have had negative impacts. Even something as small as the changes in our diets that seem to have caused an obesity epidemic are a good example; we know *something*'s to blame, but it's hard to know what. Genetic engineering is of a similar vein; there will be changes that have negative consequences but it'll be hard to identify which, or how - and how to mitigate them."
What would happen if most of the world had open borders? Why would it be bad?,[deleted]
"Why do I have to wait hours to see a doctor in the U.S. when I made an appointment a few days prior? Why, then, do they always seem to be in a rush?","Medical student here, just a few of the zillion reasons:

1) Terrible reimbursement rates for office visits = doctors need to book a lot of patients into a day to keep afloat. This is hopefully something that changes with all the healthcare reforms, because it's one of the biggest problems right now in primary car.

2) No-shows: patients skip appointments ALL. THE. TIME. I've been to some clinics where up to half of the appointments for the day don't show up (this is a poor immigrant area, I'm sure it's better in other communities, but still a problem). Docs then need to overbook so they aren't paying staff to sit around in an empty clinic, which can of course lead to very busy days in the off chance that everyone shows up.

3) ""At the door questions"": it's not infrequent for someone to spend an entire office visit describing their mild cold symptoms, and then when the doc is wrapping up / walking out the door the patient will remember that they've been vomiting blood for the last week. 

4) Charting takes up SO MUCH TIME. Depending on the hospital system and Electronic medical record, it can take almost as long to chart an uncomplicated office visit as it takes to perform one.

5) Patient phone calls, emergencies, etc

That's just a few of them off the top of my head, but really the bottom line is that unfortunately doctors are being pulled in a thousand different directions by patients, their supervisors, insurance companies, their families, their staff, etc and it means that they can't spend as much time with each patient as they would like. There's a lot of ideas being kicked around for unloading some of the burden on primary care doctors, and hopefully in the next few years we start to see some of them being successfully implemented. "

Is there actually a scenario that would satisfy ISIS enough to stop fighting? What would it be?,They believe in a religious prophecy that basically says the armies of the west will be destroyed in a pillar of fire in a biblical location corresponding roughly with modern day Syria.  They are trying to provoke the west into attacking them because they need to literally draw the armies of the west to the proper location in order for this to happen.  Their actions make a whole lot of sense when you realize it's deliberate provocation with the goal of fulfilling the prophecy in mind.
What little thing has drastically altered your life?,"That quote, ""Be the person your dog thinks you are,"" really made me sit down and think about what I was doing with my life. 

At the time, I was drinking, smoking weed, doing drugs, damn near everyday. I didn't have ""real"" friends, because my real friends were just as shitty as I was. I'd quit working, mostly due to being unable to work with my shitty ex-boyfriend, but I didn't really have a back-up plan, neither. So not only was I doing drugs, I was selling them, too. 

I was failing out of college, I was angry at everyone, and I'd just pretty much given up on ever becoming something or getting out of the rut I was in. Just seemed like things would stay the same, and I'd never get anywhere.

But then I'd come to my moms house, and would be greeted by my dog, and it'd just break my heart. He was the *only* thing in the world that seemed happy to see me, and it made me feel so guilty because he didn't *know* how shitty of a person I was, he just knew I treated him good and that was all that mattered. He loved me.

Somewhere a long that time, I saw that quote, probably on here or on Facebook. It made me cry, and looking back on it, it was kind of silly, but it's what made me put everything in perspective. I was treating the people who cared about me like shit, and putting drugs/alcohol in front of that. My dog was the only thing that didn't seem to hate me and that was only because he's incapable of comprehending all the bad shit I've done. 

I didn't do a 180 immediately, but I started getting my shit together. I haven't smoked weed since 4/20 of last year, and it's been longer than that for anything else. The last time I was ""drunk"" was on New Years, which is a huge improvement for someone who was hammered 5-6 days out of the week. 

I'm off academic probation, my GPA is close to a 3.0 now, and I have my *real* friends back. I quit hanging out with shitty people (and dumped the shitty boyfriends) and I have an amazing guy in my life now, who I know I can count on. I'm not done, but I'm far from where I was two years ago, and I'm happy. 

Edit: thanks for the gold =) very much appreciated <3"

Should dangerously obese children be taken into care? Should allowing a child without enabling health problems to become obese qualify as child abuse?,[deleted]
Why is feminine chastity more valued than masculine chastity? [in most societies],"I personally would send this one to the traditional roles of the two genders in mammals. Women have to bear the greatest fitness cost of child bearing and rearing while men have a large fitness benefit from promiscuity. Promiscuous women, on the other hand, will suffer a loss in overall fitness by failing to have a partner to help take care of a child."
Do you think automation will cause collapse of middle class?,"I'm counting on it. Considering what automation offers us, (a world free of menial and mind-numbing labor) it would be irresponsible *not* to take advantage of automation. I'd like to see us attain a level of production so high using automation, that working in exchange for money becomes obsolete. When I say us I am referring to all humans."
Why can't companies (Like Lavabit) simply refuse to disclose the information the NSA is demanding?,"An excellent question... where to start?

* The above-all, catch-all answer is that politicians are slimy and build exceptions into **everything** - everything you're mentioning is essentially guided by an exception

* The founding fathers even made clear that treason was not protected by the First Amendment

* A modern limitation on the First Amendment involves a 'clear and present danger', like yelling 'FIRE' in a crowded theater

* The 5th Amendment covers something that would incriminate yourself'- essentially it means that the government can't bully you into making a confession (esp. of something you may not have committed), or get you in trouble for keeping your mouth shut about where you were on ___ night whewhatever crime was committed.  So if it relates to evidence that someone else did, then it's not really covered here

* Why can't companies disclose their battles with the NSA?  Because our politicians are awful, and at least half of them live a delusional life, as if every single day is an episode of '24'.  See, we need the NSA because terrorists.  But it has to be secret, or it won't work.  And if you disclose the fact that the NSA wants user data, then you're exposing their program, which is an act of espionage, so you're a terrorist.  And if you're a terrorist, then you're not protected by our Amendments

Awesome logic, isn't it?


Essentially it's a combination of the USA PATRIOT Act and the Foreign Intelligence Survellance Act that gives the government so much power.  The 'snuff' orders are part of National Security Letters from the Patriot Act.

As far as party lines go on spying and surveillance, Republicans are in landslide favor of more spying (>90% total votes in favor of Patriot Act extensions, FISA extensions, etc), while Democrats are pret evenly split (roughly 50% for and against more spying).

On my tablet so not in the mood to go grabbing links from everywhere, but that should be enough to get you started, and hopefully someone else can elaborate."
Why was Germany one of the countries most spied upon by the NSA?,"Of course this is only based on speculation due to the lack of citable sources but i suspect it goes along the following lines:

* Germany being the most influential power in the european union and thus shaping their foreign and domestic policies especially in regards to armed conflicts, handling of the economical crisis and stance towards the Arabian Spring revolutions.

* Due to a high amount of muslim residents it could be feared by the US to serve as a radicalization platform for extremists. A part of the 9/11 perpetrators lived and planned in Germany.

* Protection of Privacy and Data Security are among the big values of Germany so the possibilites of the German Intelligence Agency (BND= *Bundesnachrichtendienst* literally: federal news services) are limited, so the US could see the German information gathering machine as unsufficient and stepped in to fix this. Also Germany could have requested information they are unable to obtain due to above mentioned restrictions (highly speculative).
 
* There are elections soon in Germany and even though everthing indicates a 3rd term for Merkel it could be useful to know the exact attitude of every party involved towards the US.

* As a succesful industrialized and innovative nation Germany is historically a big target for industrial espionage.

* A major concentration of internet cables and data centers is in Frankfurt am Main. The majority of all Internet traffic in Europe passes through there. 

Those are more or less the reasons, most likely it is a combination but until we know the nature of the information gathered (political, economical, surveillance of individuals...) it is hard to determine the intentions of the NSA."

"Why do we find information interesting? Is it some kind of heuristic, however indirect, for usefulness?","**This is not a source-based answer.** I could be wrong, or overlooking something.

Without information, how do we navigate our scary world? If we can't predict whether something bad will happen, we don't have enough information. If we can't understand why something good happened, we need to learn why.

---

So, people who enjoyed learning probably tended to do better than those who didn't. You didn't know when it would come in handy, even if it didn't lead to immediate action. But generally: Good information = good decisions, Bad information = bad decisions, No information = no decisions.

Alternatively, we also fear/dislike the opposite of information: the unknown. What's around the corner? What's out there in the dark? Why are my friends dying?"
Finnish education is said to be among the best in the world. How do Finnish students do when studying at non-Finnish universities?,"Finn here. Our education is ""the best"" because it produces consistent results across the entire population. In principle, everyone has equal opportunity (and legally, until age 15, a duty) to learn. In practice, this means that weak students get support to perform at the average level, but also that top students aren't really encouraged beyond the average either. This gives good results in international comparisons, but doesn't mean our students are somehow exceptionally bright. Especially if they were just suddenly thrown into an entirely different culture, they probably wouldn't do very well.

However, the ones who actually do go on to study abroad will naturally be among the most motivated and skilled individuals, so any anecdotes will be biased by that. Studying in a Finnish university myself, I can likewise tell stories about amazing students from places like Russia and Turkey. Those aren't generally renowned for their education. :)"

TL;DR:

> \[2310, p2\] Those who are sworn to serve their country in the armed forces are servants of the security and freedom of nations. If they carry out their duty honorably, they truly contribute to the common good of the nation and the maintenance of peace.
> 
> \[2313, p2\] Actions deliberately contrary to the law of nations and to its universal principles are crimes, as are the orders that command such actions. Blind obedience does not suffice to excuse those who carry them out. Thus the extermination of a people, nation, or ethnic minority must be condemned as a mortal sin. One is morally bound to resist orders that command genocide.

More context:

> ## Avoiding War
>
> * `2307` The fifth commandment forbids the intentional destruction of human life. Because of the evils and injustices that accompany all war, the Church insistently urges everyone to prayer and to action so that the divine Goodness may free us from the ancient bondage of war.
>
> * `2308` All citizens and all governments are obliged to work for the avoidance of war.
>
>   However, ""as long as the danger of war persists and there is no international authority with the necessary competence and power, governments cannot be denied the right of lawful self-defense, once all peace efforts have failed.""
>
> * `2309` The strict conditions for legitimate defense by military force require rigorous consideration. The gravity of such a decision makes it subject to rigorous conditions of moral legitimacy. At one and the same time:
>
>   - the damage inflicted by the aggressor on the nation or community of nations must be lasting, grave, and certain;
>   - all other means of putting an end to it must have been shown to be impractical or ineffective;
>   - there must be serious prospects of success;
>   - the use of arms must not produce evils and disorders graver than the evil to be eliminated. The power of modern means of destruction weighs very heavily in evaluating this condition.
>
>   These are the traditional elements enumerated in what is called the ""just war"" doctrine.
>
>   The evaluation of these conditions for moral legitimacy belongs to the prudential judgment of those who have responsibility for the common good.
>
> * `2310` Public authorities, in this case, have the right and duty to impose on citizens the obligations necessary for national defense.
>
>   Those who are sworn to serve their country in the armed forces are servants of the security and freedom of nations. If they carry out their duty honorably, they truly contribute to the common good of the nation and the maintenance of peace.
>
> * `2311` Public authorities should make equitable provision for those who for reasons of conscience refuse to bear arms; these are nonetheless obliged to serve the human community in some other way.
>
> * `2312` The Church and human reason both assert the permanent validity of the moral law during armed conflict. ""The mere fact that war has regrettably broken out does not mean that everything becomes licit between the warring parties.""
>
> * `2313` Non-combatants, wounded soldiers, and prisoners must be respected and treated humanely.
>
>   Actions deliberately contrary to the law of nations and to its universal principles are crimes, as are the orders that command such actions. Blind obedience does not suffice to excuse those who carry them out. Thus the extermination of a people, nation, or ethnic minority must be condemned as a mortal sin. One is morally bound to resist orders that command genocide.

> * `2314` ""Every act of war directed to the indiscriminate destruction of whole cities or vast areas with their inhabitants is a crime against God and man, which merits firm and unequivocal condemnation. ""A danger of modern warfare is that it provides the opportunity to those who possess modern scientific weapons especially atomic, biological, or chemical weapons - to commit such crimes."
Why am I more interested/passionate about being successful in/at video games than real life?,"Video games are designed to reward you at the right time to feel good about your accomplishments.  The rewards for real life work are often far in the future and seem disconnected from the work that accomplished them. 

Also, games have a guaranteed possibility for a successful outcome when real life has no guarantees.  You know you can be successful at a game but real life is much scarier."
"Ukraine gave up all of their Atomic Weapons under assurances. With the situation in Ukraine now, how can we ever ask a country to give up weapons or not continue a nuclear program?","Ukraine made a terrible deal. If they wanted protection in the event of an invasion, they should have written it into the agreement (""If any signatories attack or invade Ukraine, the other signatories will take military action to defend Ukraine"")."
How can magazines like the National Enquirer print obviously fake stories about celebrities without it being considered libel?,"Because of the ""actual malice"" standard in First Amendment law. Celebrities are ""public figures,"" and so discussions about them are a matter of public concern, and thus to win in a defamation claim, the celebrity has to prove the defendant acted with ""actual malice.""

In the vast majority of these cases, the Enquirer has some sort of plausibly-credible source for the allegation, and so will be able to successfully defend against the allegation they acted with ""actual malice."" 

More to the point, few celebrities want to open themselves up to ""discovery"" in the litigation they would bring. If you were, say, Tom Cruise, would you want to voluntarily expose your personal life — including putting yourself under oath at a deposition — to a lawyer for the National Enquirer?

Edited to add: If you want to see an example of some of these issues at work, see this case involving Clint Eastwood: http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14234948414064403285 The bar is quite high — not impossibly high, but high. 

Also notice who the outside counsel for the Enquirer is: David Kendall. If you recognize the name, it's because, at the same time, he was also representing President Clinton in his impeachment. The Enquirer doesn't mess around when it comes to First Amendment law. "
What is our ideal plan for the end game (covid19),"I doubt #3 is possible.  This virus will be with us forever, like influenza or common cold.

I doubt the world economy could survive #4.  It's going to be 12 months or more before we have any vaccine.

I think we'll do #2, flatten the curve.  If we get to a point where our hospitals and ICUs and ventilators are only 50% occupied, we can start relaxing quarantines.  But if the virus roars back next winter, we'll have to tighten restrictions again.  And big gatherings such as schools and sports may stay closed for a long time."
How is politics in so many countries so broken? Why is it an avenue for even the uneducated and ignorant to come into power?,"When times are tough, people get frustrated with those in power and vote for something different in the hopes it will bring about change. It's an act of desperation and hopefulness rather than one of stupidity or carelessness. 

Take 1930s Germany for example. The economy was a shit show, the country was a mess. Along came a radical politician with new ideas that represented change and hope for the country. Someone that was able to make a difference and improve things for the country. Just a shame he was, you know, Hitler."
How does one get over the need for instant gratification?,Being able to focus on something for an extended period of time is just like a muscle. You have to work on it to make it stronger.

"What is your argument against 'I have nothing to hide, so I don't care if tech giants spy on me'?","Why do they wear clothes, or have curtains, why would they not want their toilets all in the same room, no dividers?  

The desire for privacy has little to do with guilt or wrongdoing. 

In the internet’s case, I don’t want my medical information (I have googled medications I take and read up on side effects) readily available, I don’t want my employment history and salary information public, same with my private conversations with my friends.  

I certainly don’t want that available to, say, insurance companies, or marketing agencies, so that they can more efficiently try to sell me things or know how much they ‘can’ charge before it’s unsustainable. 

Society at large is based around core tenets of privacy, and there is no good reason the internet should not also share that expectation and desire. 

While there’s little good reason to make that available - at the moment, there’s already ample tools for those “with something to hide” to accomplish that, so all it does is fuck over those of us playing honestly."
Today an image of nazi who was sucker punched made it to the front page. What do you think of violence directed at those who support violent regimes but have not committed violent acts themselves?,"I cannot support or condone violence unless it is equal or necessary force in response to an attack or threat of attack on a person or persons. Proper defense is the only kind of violence I will support.

I like seeing Nazis get punched but saying it's ok to beat someone for their opinion is a horrific precedent to set. Now, the day these douches start organizing and publicly issuing real threats, it all changes. This guy got punched because someone thought he was an asshole, but if they are threatening people, it will be good defense to beat them into a non-threatinig state."
What would really happen if there were no backroom negotiations in diplomatics? Everything is public.,"Less would get done.

Are we just going through a second (global) gilded age?,"It happened with tea in India 300 years ago, It happened with cotton in the south 200 years ago, it happened with steel in the north 100 years ago, and now it’s happening with IT out west. Frankly we are right on schedule."
Would normalizing nudity be beneficial for society?,"I'm from Germany - depending on your family and environment growing up, the relationship with nudity is a lot more relaxed than in other regions of the world. There are public baths here with huge sauna areas, 15-20 different saunas, pools etc. and they are all nudist, no swimwear allowed and people move around freely fully naked. I'll answer your question having the general vibe of those places in mind.

* Crime: There is still the problem of people smuggling cameras/phones. Why do people still do that, even though they could go back any time to see more naked people? Because it's forbidden, because it gives them power over others, to keep seeing them nude whenever they want, even when the other isn't there anymore or dressed up again. Say we had no clothes at all, there would still be stalkers, obsessed, it would still be sexual for them and it would still be a crime. Same with people masturbating in public - it would still be taboo, but there would still be airheads that blame the victim of ""teasing"", trying to make them accountable for their own actions when they get caught.

* Shame: I grew up in a household, where it was normal to see each other naked, and there was no taboo. Still I remember a time growing up, when I started to feel uncomfortable with the nudity of my dad, when it had never been made into a ""thing"". So naturally, I started to keep more distance and that was accepted. When I was a teenager, I also didn't want to be seen nude anymore by mom. I became self-conscious about myself. Not that I felt shameful about my body, it just happened. Later I relaxed again, nudity with my sibblings was never too weird, but since my relationship with my mom is difficult, I don't like her seeing me naked. Even if nudity wasn't linked that closely to sex anymore, it still has to do with vulnerability, intimacy. If we were all nude all the time, maybe that would simply be expressed by keeping more distance to others, or use more formal language, which are other ways to distance yourself socially. But shame is a human emotion that doesn't necessarily have to do with nudity. Also for the male perspective: If we were all naked all the time, random boners would still be shameful. Because it shows sexual arousal, which is a very private emotion, and may be socially inappropriate at times.

* ""Men feel they achieve something when they see a woman's body. This encourages aggressive behavior"" - if we were nude all the time, men would still see it as an accomplishment to ""convince"" a woman to have sex with them, which would then encourage aggressive behavior, as long as they are ""encouraged"" to think that way. This is a problem that has to do with our minds and thoughts, not our bodies. 

* Body and health awareness: I agree in principle. The more varied the sample of natural, naked bodies you see in your life, the more realistic will your expectations will be, how your own body should be like. Of course it doesn't take away that certain people are praised for their beauty and just have more attractive bodies than yours, and the media show you both more extreme bodies and the social hype around that. People will never be fully satisfied with themselves. And while the base of the ""average"" might be broader with more examples, jealousy wouldn't go away.

* teenage pregnancy: That has less to do with nudity, and more with imparting knowledge how things work in a friendly setting that invites questions. In Germany we have pop-magazine for teenagers. Part of it are the pages of ""Dr. Summer"": when I was a teen, there was a whole pages with Q&A all about sex, and then also a doublepage with a full frontal nude selfie of a boy and a girl, where you could *gasp* see a flaccid penis! And boobies!! I don't know any stats about teenage pregnancy in Germany, but it's not really a hot topic.

TLDR: Humans will be humans - more nudity in my opinion won't eradicate feelings such as shame, power, jealousy or lust and the implications of it. But a more relaxed attitude might -surprise!- make people more relaxed overall."
People with university degrees: Do you regret choosing a degree for your interests instead of money (or vice versa)? Why?,"Bachelor of fine art here. I even have a minor in craft/metals. I was an idiot.

I did regret it for a while. I think I realized that I had made a huge mistake early in my senior year, but at that point, I figured the best thing to do was finish, get a McJob, and supplement my education bit by bit as I figure out what I want my real career to be. It was hard at first, and I was mad at myself for being so short sighed. 

Then this miraculous thing happens. You get older. The distance between you and whatever the fuck it was you did in college widens. You find a job that requires a degree in whatever and quickly learn how to use it as a springboard into something you have no formal training but plenty of work experience in. You wind up with bosses and coworkers who don't care how you spent the four years after high school as long as you're producing results. you'll have a few coworkers exactly like you, and a few coworkers who maybe had the right education earlier than you did but who simply stopped advancing because others were better at the job than them. Before long, you realize that your life looks nothing like you thought it would when you were 22, but that you have upward mobility and you're not miserable. Once you hit a certain point, nobody ever asks about your degree anymore. It takes work, probably more work than people with in demand degrees put in, but you'll build a career and your education will become a footnote on your resume. "
Why weren't helicopters used to save people on the top floors of the World Trade Center on 9/11?,"Convection. 

Those huge buildings put out a terrifying amount of heat. All that heat goes into the air, all that air rises up. You saw those smoke clouds- that's tons and tons of material, all getting forced up against gravity by the hot rising air. A helicopter would get smacked around like a toy plane in a blizzard."
"In a world with free Wi-Fi , will mobile phone networks become extinct?","The problem with free WiFi is that you're at the behest of whoever is running the connection. For instance if they want to track what you do and sell it to marketers you're not given an option of opting out. 

Having a mobile network means that your internet access it tied to one ISP so to speak.

With the way 4G and future 5G standards are moving the quality of mobile phone internet will be near or reach the level of a home connection. That will be the ideal situation especially for remote areas where WiFi range may be a few hundred metres but a mobile transmitter can reach 10s of kilometres. "
Why does it matter in politics if politicians have affairs?,"I think it's more a matter of how they lie and cover it up that shows their true character, not the affair itself."
should individuals feel an obligation to stop listening to music of bands/artists that have sexual assault allegations against them?,"There’s more than 2 options—you can hold both as truth. Because they are. 

I think a parallel here is another artist: Dr. Seuss. Just because he made some racist and offensive political cartoons in the past, it doesn’t mean that all of his other work should be burned. Nor does it mean he should get a pass and that bad stuff be forgotten. I actually teach my child that the same man did both things, good and bad. I think it helps kids better understand the real world and why people make bad choices. And that they can choose to still make better ones."
"Realistically, what are the most likely changes we'll see under the Trump administration?","One big change I think people gloss over is the Supreme Court appointment. Trump's appointment will likely lock the court down as way more conservative than the general population, and with the two oldest judges being on the liberal side, we can probably expect it to stay that conservative for at least the next decade. I wouldn't be surprised at all if this makes the court feel a bit bolder in their agenda.

Current LGBT rights are probably safe at the judicial level, but gun control, environmental issues, and roe v. wade could easily find themselves on the chopping block in the next few years."
Would free public gyms have any effect on obesity in the US?,"I don't think it'd make a noticeable difference. Not everyone has enough motivation, some people might be too obese to actually go to the gym, and dieting is also an important factor. Exercise is free and encouraged, but if public diet stays the same then there won't be much weight loss."
How does one begin to buy stocks?,"There are a lot of things to consider before jumping into the stock market.  I'll see if I can list a few important things to keep in mind:

1. Any money that you put into the stock market (your principal) is subject to potential losses, up to 100% of your principal.  This means that you can't lose more than you put in (if you're investing in stocks like you implied above), but you can lose ALL of what you put in if you choose poorly.

2. When you buy stock, you pay a certain price per share.  For instance, GE stock is currently worth $23.58 per share.  The goal that you're most familiar with when it comes to stock trading (presumably) is the increase in value of a stock from the time that you purchased it to the time you decide to sell it.  This is considered a 'bullish' position on a stock ([hence the Wall Street bull](http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/8b/a2/a4/charging-bull-wall-street.jpg)).  The opposite of a 'bullish' position is a 'bearish' position.  This is basically taking a pessimistic view of a stock.  Some people choose to engage in '[short selling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_\(finance\))' on stocks to take advantage of the anticipated price drop by borrowing stocks at one price and returning those stocks later at a lower price than they borrowed them for.

3. TAXES: When you buy a stock, the proceeds that you get by selling that stock are subject to two different tax brackets, depending on how long you held that stock.  Let's say that you bought one share of GE tomorrow for $23.58.  Next week, GE announces a fusion reactor that will fuel the planet in perpetuity and the price of a share of GE jumps to $2358.00 and you sell the stock.  Since you held the stock for less than one year, the gain on the sale of that stock is taxed like normal income.  If you're in the 25% tax bracket, that means you will be paying around $583 of your $2334.42 before tax gain to the federal government.  On the other hand, let's say that you held on to that one share of GE for one whole year and sold it on April 17, 2014; 53 weeks after you purchased it.  In this case, the gain on your stock sale is taxed as a 'capital gain'.  Capital gains tax is currently 15% for single filers with an income rate of $36,250 - $200,000 (0% below that) or 20% for single filers with incomes above $400,000 or married couples with incomes over $450,000.  This tax impact should be considered before you start buying and selling stocks often because you will pay more tax on the proceeds from stocks held less than one year than those held longer than one year.

4. There is no way to predict what will happen in the stock market tomorrow.  As many sources as there are that try to predict what's going to happen on any given day in the stock market, no average trader can accurately predict tomorrow's market prices today.  Do NOT take advice from people who claim otherwise or you will probably get robbed.

5.  With most reputable stocks, you can hope to make between 4-7% on your investment in a normal year (not like 2008-2009).  This is a stark contrast to the relative safety of US Treasury Bonds ([current yield](http://www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates-bonds/government-bonds/us/) is 0.23% for a two-year bond....that's next to nothing.  It won't beat inflation so you would lose money in the long run by keeping your money tied up in treasuries).  This also means that if someone is guaranteeing you a 20% return on investment (ROI), they're probably full of shit or running a Ponzi scheme like Bernie Madoff or something crazy.  Don't get involved with those clowns.

6.  Diversify! You don't want all your eggs in one basket.  If you have 100% of your stock funds tied up in tech stocks and another dot com bubble bursts, you could stand to lose all of your investment (principal).  If you had half of that tied up in something like retail on the other hand, you wouldn't be nearly as affected by a tech bubble burst.

There are literally hundreds of other things to add to this response, but this is at least a start.  Be careful when picking your stocks, but the earlier you start investing the more likely you are to make your money work for you.  You will appreciate that later when you live on an island in the Caribbean.

"Let’s say the world ends in some apocalypse, and the world population is down to 10% or less. With no infrastructures or societies remaining, how long would it take for mankind to come back to the state we are in now?","To me, it all depends on the first generation born after the collapse. If they receive a decent education and are able to read and understand the books around them. Then a semblance of modern society could return within a generation or two.

If that first post-collapse generation grows up ignorant it could be 10 - 100 generations to recover."
Are teenagers more docile today than they were in the 1990s?,"GenXer here. Teenagers in the 1990s came of age in a period of disillusionment. These kids watched the wild optimism of the 1960s turn into the hedonism of the 1970s and decadence of the 1980s. They were entering the job market at a time when the social contract of life-long employment was unraveling. Many of these kids were left to grow up alone (i.e. ""latchkey kids""). They were independent and cynical. 

Coming of age myself in the 1990s, I don't think we were overly wild and crazy, but we had a bitter edge that I don't see kids having today. "

Can modern Society collapse like the Western Roman Empire ?,"Yes, the post-industrial globalized society can  and will eventually collapse like the fall of Rome or the Bronze Age collapse. Possibly in our lifetime unless we either find an energy source with better energy return on energy invested (EROIE) than fossil fuels (aka fusion energy) and we can not only limit the damage from environmental degradation, pollution, and climate change but reverse it. However some will say that it is futile and collapse is inevitable because of Jevons Paradox (increase capacity/efficiency leads to increased use).

The alternative to the business as usual would be to limit both the growth of our population, economy, and therefore energy use, which I believe is unlikely given human history and human nature (see Prisoner’s dilemma). It would also lead to a decline of civilization, which is what we’re trying to avoid here. 

Simply put, there are far too many people consuming too much in an increasingly complex (or energy expensive) society given the limited resources on this planet. This has been modeled in [Limits to Growth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Limits_to_Growth) over 50 years ago, with industrial output, food per capita, and population decreasing drastically while pollution increases. 

[Joseph Tainter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Tainter) takes it further by arguing we are seeing diminishing returns in not only energy but resource extraction and innovation as well. As society becomes more and more expensive just to maintain the status quo, there comes a point where too much energy is required just to keep the system going. 

That’s not to say that we are fated to be doomed, societies have staved off collapse through long term resource/population planning and cultural adaptation that Jared Diamond mentions in [Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapse:_How_Societies_Choose_to_Fail_or_Succeed). There are also numerous cases of indigenous tribes living in a symbiotic relationship with their habitat. Also keep in mind that Thomas Malthus has been proved wrong (so far) by advancements in human innovation and capacity especially through the Industrial and Borlaug’s Green Revolution. 

And even if society collapses, it’s not necessarily a bad thing. The Renaissance and the Enlightenment advanced society more than Rome ever could, and that also goes for Classical Greece or Rome after the Bronze Age collapse. I would like to believe people can learn from our past and we aren’t doomed to repeat history. 

However, I do think we are entering an Age of Consequences as a result of overshooting Earth’s carrying capacity. Economic Inequality, ecological collapse, political polarization and paralyzation are all different sides of the same problem. 

And this time collapse may be different in that it is total; it will affect every nation AT THE SAME TIME because we are effectively turning the biosphere into people or the things people need.  

Here are some lectures from people much smarter than I am explaining it much better than I ever could.

What do you think will happen if no covid vaccine is found and will this be a new normal?,"My guess is that if no vaccine is found to be safe and effective for mass use a couple things will happen:

* Treatments will improve. Hospitals will have growing numbers of employees with first hand experience working with covid patients. Greater populations of covid positive people over greater periods of time will allow for treatments to be studied and refined.

* Multi-generational households will become more common. This trend is already on the rise due to a number of economic factors. The fact that assisted living homes are exceptionally hazardous during a pandemic will add to this trend.

* Mask use will become normalized for other illnesses. In some countries, it is considered polite to wear a mask in public if you may be sick, or are recovering from a respiratory illness. I can see this custom spreading across the world.

* Some people will stop wearing their masks because they perceive them to be pointless. Others will wear their masks indefinitely regardless of their actual likelihood of infection.

* Work from home will be adopted by industries where it is feasible. Once companies figure out how to keep people productive at home, they will want to keep people working from home because, all else equal, it is cheaper than maintaining an office.

* With the above point, there is currently a cultural divide between white and blue collar work. I think they divide will morph into ‘work from home’ and ‘commuter’ jobs.

That’s my 2c. I’m by no means an expert and I’d welcome a conversation."
"What are some good or common ways to give life meaning, purpose, or something to strive towards?",[deleted]
People who were raised by two working parents in long-hour careers - how did that impact your childhood?,"Both my parents worked. My dad always worked about 8am to 6-8pm (still does) and my mom usually worked 8:30am to 5pm and retired when I was in my first year in college. When my dad got home, he was usually really tired and he would have dinner with us, do the dishes, and then go sit in front of the TV. My mom always did most of the parenting - she played with my sister and I, fed us, gave us a bath (if my grandparents or whoever had picked us up from school hadn't yet), made sure we did our homework, all of that. On weekends, my dad played with us a bit more, but he always preferred to have us participate in his preferred activities than the other way round. My mom was always the one to make sacrifices, like asking for time off work to go to parent-teacher conferences or attending school events or skipping her favorite TV shows, and my dad rarely did any of that. In fact, throughout my school years, I'm pretty sure he was barely aware of what classes I was taking or who my teacher was or any of that. Whenever I needed help with crafts for school or something, he'd usually help reluctantly, looking at the TV more than he looked at what we were doing. In his own way, though, he showed me he cared. He taught me to drive and always remembered to see if I had my stock of my favorite cookies and he always encouraged me to be creative and put on little shows or act out plays or whatever and he'd film me and then re-watch the films lovingly almost every weekend. I resented my dad a lot throughout my teenage years for not being as present and seemingly not caring as much as my mom, but as I grew up I realized that he still cared and was so proud of me and that his personality was just... Different. 

Nowadays, I have a great relationship with both my parents, but my relationship with my dad is vastly different from my relationship with my mom. My mom is the parent I go to whenever I need something (unless it's related to something my mom doesn't understand, like car stuff), she's the parent I go to whenever I need to recall something from my childhood or whenever I need something serious, she's the parent I go to for advice. My dad is more like... A mate. We watch sports together and I tell him about the nice things that happen in my life and he gets excited and we play cards and drink together and all of that, but I don't feel too comfortable talking about serious topics with him or asking him for life advice. And whenever something from my childhood comes up and he knows nothing about it, I get a little pissed because it reminds me of how little involvement he had in some parts of it. 

So, in my experience, parents working doesn't make them bad parents. You can still be a good, loving, caring parent while being a working one. The important part is what you do with the time that you spend with your kid and that involves accepting that you will probably have to sacrifice a good chunk of your own personal time. As long as you love and care for your future kid(s), they are bound to remember that for years to come. However, the kind of relationship you have with them when they're kids is surely going to impact how they perceive you, specially as teenagers and adults. I really don't think the issue lies with working or not working, but rather with what you do with the time when you're not working."
Is the present the most anti-alcohol and anti-nudity era in the post-1970 history of the world?,"About the topless in Europe part: I think it has much to do with the existence of phones with cameras and the internet. As a girl/woman, you might not mind people at the beach seeing your chest but if someone puts a picture of you online and one of your classmates or coworkers sees it, it's a whole other story"
Why is marijuana considered a gateway drug while alcohol is not?,"Marijuana has been the subject of a fierce PR battle to ensure people think it's terrible. Why that is is the subject of much debate, and what you believe probably depends on who you're listening to. I think a good summary of that whole discussion is: A lot of powerful people make a lot of money because alcohol is legal and a lot of powerful people make a lot of money because marijuana is illegal. 

But the reason the gateway theory became popular is that ""Most hard drug users use marijuana before trying harder drugs."" This is silly for obvious reasons. (Most hard drug users also eat bread before trying hard drugs as well. Most marijuana users do not go on to use hard drugs.) 

Very few legitimate sources actually believe the ""gateway"" theory any more. "
How can we realistically curb the amount of shootings occurring in the U.S.?,"There's a lot of stuff here that I think is good.  Top rated comment right now is about the mental health system.  That's great.

Then there are people talking about problems with racial inequality, and that is also spot on and great.

So I'm going to confine my comments to something that doesn't get talked about much.  America is just a violent ass country.  I grew up there.  All through elementary and high school I was getting in to fights.  Lots of kids did.  When I moved to Germany as an adult I was surprised to find out that most Germans go through their entire lives without ever getting into a fist fight.

But that's just something we accept.  Sure, we've started cracking down on bullying etc., and that's great, but even so American children are exposed to more violence than people in other industrialized countries and we accept it as normal.  

What is more we encourage it.  Most other countries do not have school sporting teams but in America it's a big deal if you can get onto the team.  Especially football is a huge deal in a lot of high schools.  I remember walking into my school cafeteria when I was 16 and watching the team psyche themselves up before a big game.  They were working themselves into a fury.  They weren't talking about winning.  They were talking about ""killing"" the other team.  It was extremely unsettling.

And look at how we treat soldiers.  I understand that someone who fights to defend your country deserves to have their sacrifice recognized, but we raise our military up like almost no other country I can think of.  I know plenty of Europeans who will buy a vet a beer, but none who wear ribbons or who hold soldiers up as examples to extremely young boys.

We weren't always like this.  Somewhere along the line we went from maintaining a very small standing army to a country that keeps spends more on it's military than everyone else put together.  Somehow we think it's normal and even take pride in it.  The only manufacturing that we do anymore is weapons.  Our only real export is war.  Why are we surprised when that bleeds over into our daily life?

"What are some ""flaws"" of the human body?","The blood vessels supplying your retinas are *in front* of the rod and cone cells that actually detect light - light has to pass through the blood vessels to get to them.

Your brain has learned this, and compensates for it. However, you can still see them if you want to:

* Take a piece of card, make a small hole in it with a pin. Alternatively, curl up your index finger so that there's just a small hole in the middle.
* Close one eye and hold the piece of card in front of the other eye. 
* Wave the card back and fore whilst looking at a white screen or wall.

If you get the speed of waving right, you'll be able to see the shadows created by the blood vessels on your retina.

Has anyone thought how different today would be from one insignificant decision or factor that happened many years ago?,"I missed my application to grad school because the deadline was at noon and I thought it was midnight. Ended up pursuing a different graduate degree at another university, dropping out, working half a year and then pursuing a degree similar to the first at a third university. In addition to finishing my education a year later; at my final university, I worked on a few projects that qualified me for my current job. I'd be in a completely different place if I'd opened that application form two hours earlier.

Also, I have kids. But if I'd had sex at a different time or maybe even in a different position, another sperm might have won the race and I'd have different kids. Same goes for me, you, anyone else. A slight change would mean non-existence.

TL;DR yes."

Why do charities stop me for money when there are multi-billionaires in the world?,"My wife is a professional fundraiser.

What part of the brain is the voice in your head?,"Briefly, it is an agglomeration of several processes in the brain, called the Default Mode Network.

The voice you hear is how the brain is translating all that activity, and why it is really hard to shut it off. See Michael Pollan's How To Change Your Mind for a better description than I have here."
"People have taken to saying ""This is exactly what ISIS wants"" when talking about Islamophobia, fear mongering, and the degradation of civil liberties. Is this actually what Daesh wants?","   For sure. 

   The more Muslims are alienated and shown that the West hates them, the easier they are to radicalize. Take for example the situation in France. The living standards for immigrants is anything but ideal, more often they're forced into ghettos which become breeding grounds for extremists to find shunned youth to convert. Even people born on French soil but in the banlieues grow up with a warped sense of us vs them. Add in islamophobia, which further the divide between the groups and there you have it.

   Daesh also hates the fact people are leaving Syria. If you read the Dabiq you'll see their ""confusion"". More islamophobia, less acceptance of refugees, more people stuck under their thumb. Another reason why countries that are welcoming to refugees are more at risk. "
What do the people of North Korea think is happening in the outside world?,"1. It is a totalitarian state, and therefore the average North Korean's knowledge of the outside world is specifically tailored in a certain way. The regime will admit to some economic failings, but they certainly don't teach average North Koreans that NK languishes economically compared to the vast majority of the developed world. And so North Koreans may get some sense that not everything is perfect economically (90s famines are still a living memory), but probably don't understand just how truly backwards the country is. 

2. [There is a prevalent black market through which western goods are reaching the hands of ordinary Koreans more and more commonly.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/9258974/North-Koreans-secretly-watching-foreign-media.html) These allow North Koreans to watch SK movies, dramas, and other visual clues demonstrating the inferiority of the NK economy. [The totalitarian regime is trying to crackdown on these smuggled DVDs, because they realize that it undermines their official party line.](http://www.rfa.org/english/news/korea/radios-02282014160921.html) However, the black market has become a pervasive and socially acceptable part of daily North Korean life among ordinary North Koreans after the collapse of their food distribution systems in the 90s. This means that their efforts will probably be futile, as the avenues being utilized to trade DVDs and USBs are also vital for fuel, food, medicine, etc because the North Korean regime is simply no longer able to distribute it effectively themselves. Foreign media will continue to proliferate, and in doing so will continue to be at odds with what the party tells North Koreans. They will basically have to choose what to believe, foreign media or the party?

3. North Korean elites in Pyongyang have already enjoyed access to foreign media for some time, and most likely have a fairly good grasp as to the disparities between North Korean and South Korea economically. 

As to your questions:

>How much do they learn in school?

They learn what the party allows them to hear in school, and so schooling for ordinary NK citizens will not give them a solid grasp as to the true economic realities for North Korea and around the world. 

>What kind of internet access (if any) do they get?

Ordinary North Koreans have none, and the elites that do are probably closely monitored (a solid example is the Vice documentary on NK. They take them to a computer lab to show them how they allow internet access now. Except with carefully viewing, as elaborated by the film crew in a voice over, it's painfully obvious none of these actors know how to utilize the internet. A classic scene is a man endlessly scrolling around the google search bar start page. Never typing any search in, just scrolling.)

However, they do have some black market access to foreign media, and despite the crackdown, it is lifting the veil off the eyes of many ordinary NK citizens. 

>Is there approval for their dictator?

Overwhelmingly among the common people (although probably much less so among elites). These people have lived their entire lives under a [cult of personality.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_of_personality). Certainly there are North Koreans who simply play along for safety reasons, but I have to fundamentally disagree with those in this thread who say many, or even most, are playing a long out of fear and know it is all bullshit. Even defectors who have gotten to a point where they were willing to risk their lives to reach SK still spoke about trying not to think about Kim Jong Un as they crossed, because they felt like they were betraying him and he could read their minds (source on this one is the Vice doc on NK refugees in SK).
"
Does society require the poor/lower class in order to function correctly? Can there be those who are rich without there being people those who are dirt poor?,"Yes, but it will require an artificial workforce to replace the existing one. China actually seems on the right track to produce an automated artificial workforce, perhaps we'll see Google or IBM pick up the pieces for the west.

But upon acquiring an artificial workforce there is no reason why anything wouldn't be more than the cost of electricity to manufacture it, making everything essentially free. 

The hard bit will be the transition from our current workforce to that. As more and more citizens are replaced at their jobs by robots, the government will have to step in to handle the rapidly growing unemployed population.

Is hypnotism real?,"In order to wholly answer your question, we need to draw the distinction between the term 'hypnotism' and the glamorized buzzword 'HYPNOTISM' (*with sparkles and sparks and mysterious awe*).

Hypnotism as seen on tv, in night clubs, and with your friends who say ""Hey, I can totally do hypnotism"", is mostly stylized and a big hype.  I'm not saying that the professional entertainers out there don't actually draw people into a suggestive state...I'm just saying that there tends to be a lot of crowd pleasing going on there.

Hypnosis from its clinical origin was all about putting the mind in a suggestive state in order to accomplish some goal **at the willingness of the patient**.  Those tv shows where someone who's hypnotized and the doctor ""forces"" them to relive a past traumatic memory? bullshit.  That's not how the art of mesmerizing is supposed to work.  For hypnosis to work, you need two things; 1) a willing participant, and 2) someone who's open to suggestion.  Short of strapping you to a chair and torturing you until I 'break your mind' in order to reprogram you, there isn't a whole lot to be gained from trying to hypnotize you if you think I'm full of crap.  

Hypnosis is used to induce a relaxed, 'suggestible' state.  It is then that the hypnotist can give his participant a suggestion (say, 'You're back at the point where you were brutally assaulted'...or 'your hand is as heavy as a concrete boulder'...or, to be silly, 'your teeth taste like rubber bands').  There is **no forcing someone to do something**.  If you ever saw a person bragging about how they ""made"" a person do something, then they're either misinformed or full of crap  -- either way, you should call them on it.  

**tl;dr - hypnosis *is* real, just maybe not in the way most people understand it**

EDIT - Check out *Powers of Hypnosis* by Jean Dauven.  Also, here's a neat little suggestive mind trick to try on your friends, you'll be surprised how many people get taken;

Ask your friend to spell a series of words as fast as they can.  When they agree, say ""As fast as you can, spell ROAST!"" (they spell roast), then ""Spell COAST!"" (they spell coast), then ""Spell BOAST!"" (they spell boast).  Then ask them ""What do you put in a toaster?"", to which most people will exclaim ""TOAST!"", then you smile and say ""no! you put bread in a toaster, silly!"".

That's a great party trick that really illustrates the idea of putting someones mind in a suggestive state, and then suggesting they feed you a funny answer.  Try it sometime :)"
"Why is it considered permissible for celebrity nude candids/nipslips/etc to be plastered all over the internet (including reddit) but amateur ""revenge porn"" websites and creepshot subreddits get shut down?","The legal reason: Public figures are held to a different privacy standard.

Are Zoos Morally Wrong?,"I think that if the habitat is right, it's fine.

For example: many snakes don't need a whole lot of room as long as they have a cool side, a warm side, and proper temp/humidity control. Elephants, however, need a *vast* amount of space and keeping one in a zoo is akin to keeping a goldfish in a drinking glass. "
"Can you truly change the person you are, or do you just manage?","You can definitely change but it takes a lot of time and work and active self correction along the way. But I think the best approach is to be honest with yourself and understand your flaws, work around them while you fix them."
What can someone do to make their relationships feel more connected and meaningful?,"Yes, the secret is vulnerability. You can be surrounded by people constantly, but if you aren’t able to be seen and accepted as your true self, you’ll never feel a deeper connection. Meaningful connections come from the trust that develops through being vulnerable. You should check out Brene Brown’s books and TED talks. Her life’s work and research is on vulnerability and how it can deepen and strengthen your relationships. "
Does it take a common enemy of humanity to make humans overcome their differences and hatred for each other?,"Probably. Human nature is very focused on in-group vs out-group, “us” vs “them.” The only way we’ll perceive all of humanity as one big “us” is to have a giant existential threat fulfill the role of “them.” Until that happens we’ll probably keep fighting over resources amongst ourselves."
How do you tell the difference between self-limitations you should push past and ones you should respect?,"You actually described them really well! Another way to confirm is how you feel afterward. Do you feel dread at the idea of hanging out with certain people, or kind of gross after you see them, or find yourself turning to bad coping habits? Or do you feel a bit nervous but then proud you did it; or energized after doing something you’d been putting off. 

Another way to know is to imagine if you told a friend who cared about you, what would they say? Or actually tell a friend and see what they say. "
"Gravity on Mars is about 38% as strong as gravity on Earth. Will this cause any health problems for humans, should they reach Mars?",">Evolution of course will fix this issue over thousands of years but it seems as if the first few thousand generations born on Mars will experience some seriously stunted development of bones and muscles as a result of the profoundly weak Martian gravity not demanding nearly as much from them.

Uhhh... that's assuming we allow evolutionary pressures to take place. Your statement is predicated on the assumption that martians will completely throw away conventional morality, and that martian society will deliberately cull -- or at least allow to die through neglect -- those of inferior physical fitness. Which generally is the opposite of what we do on earth, what with billions being spent on curing illness and widespread medical care (where national finances allow).

**But back to the original question,** the effect of gravity. Now the effect of microgravity (which is different than low gravity) is well documented. Problems include skeletal degradation, severe loss of muscle mass, space adaptation sickness (confusion of the inner ear's mechanisms that normally give us a sense of balance), and malformation of the body due to the lack of gravity (eyeballs flatten to blur vision, liquids pressure tends to push liquids upwards due to the lack of gravity to counter-balance). No one is completely sure about how bad these effects may be on Mars, simply because we don't have any 0.4G habitats we can stick people in for months on end to watch.

But gravity is hardly the only problem.

On top of that, Mars' weak atmosphere means you're basically taking a consistently heavy dose of radiation -- or one would assume, given the limits of radiation shielding technology in the foreseeable future. So on top of the complications of low gravity are the complications of radiation exposure. There are some medicines and techniques for handling radiation exposure, but most of it is just acute doses. There's not much on prolonged human exposure to consistent, moderate levels of radiation over an entire lifespan.

And then there's the dust. So much, super-fine dust. Mars' dirt has been blasted again and again by impacts, turning it into an extremely fine powder that makes earth dust look like pebbles. Our technology, to say nothing of our bodies, are not well-designed to keep it out. So you'll have dust in your water, in your food, in your bloodsteam... the consequences of which are not entirely well documented. So there's that, too."
What if Al Gore had won against Bush in the presidential election? Would the focus have shifted from terrorism to the environment?,"It's worth mentioning that fighting terrorism was *not* a primary focus of the Bush administration initially.  Bush was elected in January 2001, after campaigning on mostly domestic issues (reforming education, reforming social security and medicare, lowering taxes), and he went so far as to say (in a presidential debate that ""I don't think our troops ought to be used for what's called nation-building"" (referring to Clinton's military activities in Somalia.  

Bush's 8 months in office before 9/11 were marked by the beginnings of an education overhaul (what would become No Child Left Behind), promotion of ""faith-based initiatives"", a tax-relief package, and putting together a new budget.  Combating terrorism was not a significant part of his agenda.  September 11 changed all that.

That's the reason why I don't know how things would be different now.  I think any president in office on that day *might* have conceivably had a radical shift in their priorities and policies.  I like to think that Gore would have handled the immediate crisis differently, used the opportunity to build bridges around the world rather than simply exert might, and would have retained his strong commitment to the environment ... but I'm just not sure."
"What is the difference between Obamacere requiring citizens to buy health insurance, and penalizing drivers who don't have auto insurance","One key difference is the beneficiary.  The beneficiary of your car insurance--at least the part you're mandated to have--is not you, but the person you crash in to.  The beneficiary of your health insurance is you.

So we could say that you have a societal obligation to make sure you have the means to correct any wrong you do to someone else on the road.  But you don't necessarily have a societal obligation to take care of your own health--you just have a personal obligation.

Of course the whole issue is more complicated than that, but that's the key difference."
How likely is it that another great pandemic could occur? How would the world react and what places would be hit the hardest?,"To add to your list, Cairo. Major transport hubs would suffer too. If it's bird flu related I think the Far East is likely to be hit first, Hong Kong, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok. 

One of the factors with diseases and how they spread is incubation period and how quickly it kills you. Apparently the Ebola virus doesn't spread very well because the mortality rate is so high (fewer survivors to carry it) and because death is swift.

I suppose if there was a genuine outbreak affecting several continents the world would react in a pragmatic and reasoned manner and not at all like in disease films where there is mass panic and swift intervention by the armed forces. No wait..."
"What is the average day of a drug addict like, and how do drug addicts afford their drugs?","I'm a heroin addict. Currently clean. But I'll do my best to describe what it's like.

Imagine the thing you love most in this world. Imagine what you would do if it was taken away from you. Now imagine having to go through losing it daily, and having to do whatever it takes to get it back. Every day. Whatever it takes.

It's not a *want*. It's a *need*. It comes before everything: food, water, a place to live, loved ones, safety. It's not because you don't care about these things. In your head you know things things are what makes you human. It's because this chemical produces a feeling inside of you that cannot be replicated by any other means. The feeling hijacks the motivation center of your brain, and the drug equals survival. Your instinct to survive is what drives you to do these terrible things. Your brain is screaming, your *entire being* is screaming for more, or else you will die (you won't, but you sure as hell think you will). In the face of death, real or perceived, a human will revert to an animalistic state. Fight or flight and all that. An addict, almost without question will *fight* for what they think they need. Typically this involves getting money.

Some things in the past that I have done for money: shoplifted, pawned every possession I own, committed check fraud, and overdrawn 5+ bank accounts. I stole from my mother, my friends, my brother, my roommates. Burned every bridge I've ever crossed, and I never looked back. The consequences didn't matter. The drug mattered. That which had hijacked my survival instinct mattered, and nothing else. "

"Forget happiness, how do I achieve complacency?","I'm older than you. And good news: age does this automatically.

It sort of dulls the highs and lows. Possibly because you've seen then before, or simply because the roller coaster isn't as fun the 1,000th time. When you hit 30 something shifts. Some it takes a bit after, but time heals all.

In the immediate: allow yourself to chase whatever happy means today. Don't judge yourself for this changing or growing or leaving. Be a leaf blowing in the wind.

Never allow other people's crazy to infect you. We allow social media, or TV, or coworkers, or our family impact our headspace. Start paying attention to who makes you feel bad or sad, and start to carve them out of your life. Removing the negative is a step to avoiding the bad.

And I want to say that you are wise. Happiness is a trap. It exists in fleeting pockets. Chasing it, or hoping to catch it in a jar is a waste of time. Because we'll be wondering why we can't have it each and every moment of the day. Hoping for complacency shows a cleverness beyond years.

Good luck!"
Does increasing minimum wage actually hurt small businesses?,"[Awesome podcast discussing this topic](http://thegoodfight.fm/episodes/20-minimum-wage-myths-busted)

Basically, the answer is NO. The podcast discusses several studies done in areas that are right next to each other geographically and similar demographically but across county or state lines which have different minimum wages. The areas with higher minimum wages do not see drops in employment and businesses didn't suffer when rates were changed.

The studies were a surprise to economists and there are several reasons that raising minimum wages doesn't hurt businesses as much as owners think it will. Some of the ones I remember include:
 
* All businesses' costs are going up together. If you have to raise prices, you won't lose business to other places because they'll be raising prices too. 

* If everyone in the area starts making more money, they'll have more to spend at your business.

* Paying employees more makes them work better and happier and lowers turnover."
"Older people of reddit, how do hopes and dreams change as you get older?","For me my hopes and dreams were rather wild when I was younger. Then I bought a house which cut my immediate options down but expanded them for later in life. Then I met a girl and got married which again cut my immediate options down but expanded them for later in my life too. 

In short while you're younger almost everything is possible but requires lots of effort one way or another. When you get older you've made plenty of decisions in your life which puts a lot of options to bed but if you've chosen wisely enough gives you some freedoms you just don't have when you're younger.  

That's the way I see things anyway"
Are most people miserable most of the time?,"Misery loves company. If you go looking for misery, you’re going to find it. Most people are going to cater the platform they are given- whether that is misery or happiness. If you went looking for happiness in the same manner, you would have similar outcomes, I’m sure. Or maybe I’m just being optimistic in my thinking that most people aren’t miserable, who knows."

How do I build a steady reading habit?,"Set an alarm on your phone every day when you know you'll have 15-20 minutes to sit and read. Set a timer when you start, and continue reading until the timer goes off. If you want to keep going, you can, but the most important thing is to regularly spend a small amount of time reading, but don't make it a big committment that you feel daunted by - start with 15 minutes, and once you get into it you'll find you won't need the alarm or the timer. 

Also, you may want to start with a topic or genre you like so it's easier to get started."

Is it possible that being happy nowadays is not exactly a good thing anymore?,[removed]
Why is the center not represented more often in politics,"It's a combination of two things in the US: 

 * First Past the Post elections mean that there can only be two viable political parties or else people end up eating their own base. For example in Maine's governor's race, There was a center left candidate, a left candidate, and a right candidate. The left candidates ended up with more votes combined, but the right candidate got the most votes overall. So he was elected, though most people didn't want him  

 * Second, most races are heavily gerrymandered. So whoever wins the primary of the favored party will usually win the election. That usually means that you need to be more extreme than your opponent to win.  

So when you combine those two factors, you get just two extreme candidates.

(There are of course some specific counterexamples, but I'm just talking in general)"

When is suicide the answer?,"""The so-called ‘psychotically depressed’ person who tries to kill herself doesn't do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life's assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire's flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It's not desiring the fall; it's terror of the flames. Yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don‘t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You'd have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.""

People who got their higher education later in life. What was your experience?,"I'll be 28 in August. I work full-time and have since I was 17, often working two or more jobs. Regardless of what people say, it's really incredibly difficult to make it without a college degree. I've worked in a multitude of fields: legal, non-profit, petroleum, retail, insurance. I've always planned on ""one day"" getting my degree, but life ended up getting in the way, somehow. 

I've been going to community college for the last year and a half, and I'll be a junior in the fall. I'm finally transferring to a university - one out of state and a great, nationally-ranked school. I've been in school full time while working to support myself during the day. I plan on quitting work (or working MUCH less) when I go to school in the fall - I want to get my BS done as fast as possible, hopefully in 1.5 years. My major is Statistics, with a possible minor or double major in Economics. 

It is NEVER too late to go back. If anyone tells you the opposite, punch them in the face and laugh all the way back to school. People have been telling me my whole life that I'm lazy, incapable of getting a degree, too head-strong or stupid to do well in school. One person believing in me has changed all that. Yes, I'm tired day in and day out. Yes, I would rather be spending time with my SO than studying. Yes, I regret not doing this earlier. But you know what? It's MY life, and I will get that damned degree. Since I've worked so much, I've become accustomed to not having enough time in the day - so substituting work for school work has been a relatively simple transition. 

My age has not impaired me. On the contrary, I believe my experience has enhanced my school experience. I think critically about the information presented, and I'm quick to grasp new concepts (a skill I needed to develop working in so many varied fields). 

You mention that you want to take six months off for travelling. My advice: don't. It's too easy to say, Oh, it's just six months! Then six months becomes nine, then a year, and before you know it, three years have passed and you haven't gone back. It's never going to get easier: going back will ALWAYS look like a daunting task until you're in it and getting classes behind you. Hell, it STILL seems daunting to me! My big milestone was taking college algebra this semester: I had to take three remedial math courses to get here, and it felt like I would never get those out of the way. My first day in my CA class was surreal. 

The biggest non-self-imposed obstacle I encountered was being in class with a bunch of snot-nosed kids who don't give a flying fuck about their education and just want to party all the time. I hated them. Here I was, tired and exhausted from working all day, only to have them come in stinking of booze and pot and falling asleep during the class. It took some time for me to realize that I am there for ME - if they don't want to get the most out of the money spend for the class, what should I care?

Honestly, going back has been the best thing I've ever done. It's helped me to grow as a person, and really given me purpose and direction in life - not only to do well in school, but it's helped me figure out what I want to *do* with the rest of my life. 

If you are considering going back: I believe in you! You can do it, and I really do think that you'll get more satisfaction from life. I know college ""isn't for everyone"" - but if you're strongly considering going back, then it *is* for you. :) 

**TLDR: Went back to school at 26, now nearly 28 and transferring to a Uni in the fall. Love it, can't wait to graduate. If you want to go back, screw everything and everyone else and just DO IT. Stop making excuses, and git 'er done. :)**"
What are some notable cultural differences between the United States and Canada?,"Canadian here. Well, we're more alike than we are different but here goes:
There's less of a gun culture here, keeping in mind the more rural you get the more pro-gun you get.  

We're not as nationalistic and more willing to see political dissent as part of 'making the country better' In this same vein we're less married to city/town/province pride. We tend to not identify ourselves by where we're from unlike, say, the 'East Philly represent' or 'New York is the greatest city in the world' type of statements. 

It's a thin population over a very large area so there's a perceived struggle over 'national identity'. This, I personally attribute to being so close to the Untied States where (from a Canadian perspective) the patriotism comes off as near bullying.  
  
A combination of less selection (in goods, services, pricing), isolation  and brutally cold winters gives us an air of British stoicism. ""Carry on, stiff upper lip"". This is where the 'polite Canadian' stereotype comes from. It's a near oxymoronic combination of empathy (yeah, we've all been there) and apathy (why stir up the shit by saying something mean? Who needs the hassle? I got my own shit to deal with)  
  
Which brings to mind a sort of 'mind your own business' mentality that is pervasive in Canadian society. We really don't want to chime in on your conversation, peak in your windows or spend too much time thinking about anyone else's opinion. We're not interested in trying to change anyone's mind and it would be ill-advised to try to change ours.  The plus side is a great degree of multiculturalism and tolerance and the downside is we occasionally down't give a shit when we should. 
  
Ok, here's the caveat: these are VERY broad generalizations and there are boatloads of people that will, rightly, disagree with them. There are examples left and right to prove and disprove all of the above. But that's my two cents. Oh, shit. We don't have pennies anymore. That's my..uh…two nickels."
"Gentrification: If it's a problem for people with more money to move into places like Brooklyn, the Mission District in San Francisco and Oakland, where are they supposed to go?","I think the problem is the displacement of culture. I've lived in Brooklyn for about 15 years, and I can't think of a single person that thinks the growth and development is bad. But you do have a very different landscape.

When I got my first apartment it was in the heart of Bed stuy, 2br 1200/mo, half utilities included. Now the same place goes for 1900/mo zero utilities. The buyers/sellers are seeing even greater gains, houses you wouldn't have sold for 200k are easily going for 750k that need to be renovated. 750k, you need an income of about 150k for conventional financing... even in NYC jobs like that don't just pop up. When they do, you don't anticipate yourself living in Bed Stuy.

Now, there is something very appealing about living there; the architecture is amazing, the details in the house would cost a fortune to duplicate, and the pp/sqft is in the low 200's whereas a neighborhood like Brooklyn Heights (some parts of BK have always been nice) will run you 650-1000+ sq ft. Plus the taxes are much lower in these gentrifying enclaves. It's not about having too many people or not enough houses, it's about a certain type of person trying to replicate a certain lifestyle that isn't conventional. But papers have been written that show this isn't some sort of guerilla real estate market; people don't migrate to or from gentrifying neighborhoods faster than any other market. Certain types of people do though, those with ambition (fixer uppers) and a desire to stretch their dollars further.

Insofar as a moral obligation, I think your only obligation is to leave something better than when you first encountered it. Spike Lee rants about how nice the Fort Greene park is... cry me a river. Communities are always changing, Soho used to be a bunch of factories, then it was artists lofts, now it's financier coops, who knows maybe in 20 years it will be too expensive for them and go commercial again.

Money helps but it isn't the only thing, it just makes finding a place easier if you have more. 

Edit: Where are the old neighborhood people supposed to go? That's difficult to answer because it isn't a specific range of people. Some of them die, some go off to school, some find jobs elsewhere, a lot of things have to line up to make gentrification possible. I would go so far as to say that in a neighborhood that gentrifies there are probably far more winners than losers financially and culturally. There will be losers, but there are losers in any neighborhood, even when I lived in BK Heights people were getting evicted."
Will America ever see a more-than 2-party system come into play? Is it worth it to vote 3rd party?,"The two party system is caused by our [first-past-the-post electoral process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo).  When the public demands a preferential voting system (like the [alternative vote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y3jE3B8HsE) and [others](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_voting_systems)) the media will start covering elections as if there are more than two parties.  Of course the two parties will always be against this as third, forth, fifth party viability dilutes their strength.   
   
EDIT: Because some people are asking ""But how?"" In the US adoption of this electoral process would happen state by state.  State legislatures can set their electoral process when electing Senators and Congressmen.  This is how it would likely start and then spread.  They could also implement electoral college rules where votes are divided proportionally among the candidates and in the event where a Presidential candidate doesn't have 50% support the candidate with the fewest electoral college votes gets eliminated and those votes are recalculated and allocated according to the rules of the Alternative Vote."

What moments of disillusionment have you experienced in your life? Have you ever had your understanding of your cultural/religious/political/geographic surroundings totally upended?,"In 2015, I was the victim of a crime, got a concussion, and in a split second, I was a very different person. Since then, it's been pretty hard to take the idea of ""personalities"" or ""people"" or ""individuals"" seriously in the way I used to. If you can be radically altered by a single blow to the head, what is the ""you"" that's being changed?

How would the President of USA go about turning the country into a dictatorship? What steps would he need to do? What people would he have to replace?,"People keep referencing what it takes to change the constitution, but seem to forget that our government (chiefly the Supreme Court, the Justice Department and congress) is in charge of interpreting, following and enforcing the constitution. Not a single letter of that document has any power if the people who are meant to follow it choose not to."
"How can you achieve a balance in the Dunning-Kreuger effect between feeling confident of your abilities or of what you know, and realizing the fact that there are things that you do not know or that you are not as competent in as you think you are?","Not sure if it completely answers your question, but I find the difference is that those who are actually intelligent, but doubt themselves are more willing and accepting when it comes to learning. Whereas people under the effect you are talking about are more inclined to believe there is nothing they don't know, from my experience."
Where is the line for when we should blame the person or biology when people do evil things?,"I feel bad for people in general. We're born into a body that is hardwired to survive, and many survival techniques are considered evil. If you're greedy, good job, you're trying to survive as biology dictates. Went around cheating on your partner or had sex with someone in a relationship? Again that's excellent, doing anything you can to reproduce. Are you a massive thrill seeker and often get into trouble in efforts to chase a rush? That sucks, because you probably have a dopamin e polymorphism and you will always be more susceptible to troublesome activities because of that. 

People may be ""evil"" for reasons not related to biology. For example, kids that have been abused by parents tend to bully other kids more. Sure the abused child is performing actions out of his own will, but how much of that is truly the result of critical thought, and how much is because of the way the child has been nurtured?

For the most part, I think society as a whole is to blame, not the people. Humans and animals in general are beings that exhibit behaviour based on their genetics and based on what they learn. I don't think it's possible to say that someone is the way they are because of... their own thinking I guess? It's tough to even put it in words. How else is a person supposed to form their own behaviour, when their brains are entirely shaped by genetics and environment? So that's why I say we should blame society. Only as a collective can we do a better job of raising people an environment that will foster ""good"" personalities, and for the portions that are controlled by genetics, we could put more into R&D to figure out how to manage that. 

Despite what I just said, if we want to enforce our morals (I mean, I don't want people to be able to punch me just because they've been abused as a child) then individuals still have to be held accountable. I've been screwed over badly by two different people that suffered from major depression. It was infuriating, but eventually I managed to forgive them due to their illness. They were always prone to making the wrong choices, even though the tried their best to make the right ones. Think about a time when you knew you had to do some homework, but you just couldn't get yourself off the xbox. Emotions and deep urges are super hard to control. However, this doesn't mean that playing Xbox is a good reason to get an extension. Just because I forgavy my former friends, doesn't I have to ever trust or associate with them again. I use this train of thought anytime someone makes the ""evil"" choice."
How could the industrialized world reasonably end the outdated 8 hour work day?,"The concept was first championed before electricity was common in the workplace, before child labor laws were written, and before modern technology created mass increases in efficiency and production. The modern worker in many industries can get 100x more accomplished today than a hundred years ago, when businesses first started standardizing the 8-hour workday. "

What makes the Coronavirus Pandemic of now so different from the 2009 H1N1 flu?,"What an Italian Intensivist Doctor said was, in his 40 years of working, he has never seen another infectious disease like this. It just fills up infectious disease wards, then the ICU, then the whole hospital. This is because at least 10% of all infected need hospitalisation and about a third of those requiring ICU. Combined with its ridiculous infectivity, this allows it to completely overwhelm healthcare systems. When hospitals get full then the disease becomes a lot more lethal.

 In Italy they have completely run out of ventilators, without one, they die. They have to give them to people without pre-existing conditions and those who are younger because they have the best chance of survival. That means they are just leaving some people to die, because they just don't have the resources to save them. If Italy hadn't locked down it could have feasibly gotten 10x worse than that."
How do we ACTUALLY support and help depressed loved ones?,"Not necessarily specific advice about *how* to support someone, but this tidbit might help.

DO something.  Don't *offer* to do something, but actually fucking do it.  The last thing anyone in need wants to hear is, **""let me know if you need anything!""**

Fuck that.  You're putting the onus on them to ask for help, and to identify what they need.  Chances are, if someone is depressed, they don't actually know what will help.  

Come over to play Xbox.  Bring a pizza.  Take them out for a beer.  Take them to a strip club if that's their thing.  

The point is to *do something* without being asked or prompted.  

You'll see similar advice for how to help couples with a newborn.  Or for someone who just got out of the hospital.  

Expecting the person to ""let you know"" is one of the biggest cop outs ever.

Hope that helps."

If everybody was fiscally responsible would the economy collapse?,"There will certainty be a deflation and it will hurt like hell. The ideal fiscally responsible actor would be saver and investor. The current economy has been stretched like a rubber band with high level of consumption. Without enough people keeping the force to hold this 'stretch' by spending (on non-essential stuff), this band will snap back in form of high unemployment, bankruptcies and pain all around. Dollar you spend is an income for another, and that income is what pays debt. If this cycle cannot sustain, the effect of deleveraging will freeze credit, which will cut research, jobs, and all that and more.

After long periods of adjustment we will emerge with new style of economics, one that does not depend on hyper spending. What will this look like? It's hard to say given that it's path dependant (from where we currently stand, downhill). But if history is of any indication, depression and shit. On the plus side, the environment will be doing super well.

Money has to flow, or economy freeze and dies. That's why it's called 'currency'. I'm not saying current system is good or bad. We just ended up here and it is what it is. Changing it now to fiscally responsible culture would create shock beyond what we can handle."
"What is privilege, and more importantly, what is the opposite of ""privilege""? Help me understand this concept.","Privilege as a concept could be loosely translated as ""Unearned advantages"" (edit: as has been pointed out, the 'unearned' part is debatable) - big or small things that make some aspect of your life easier or better than other people's and that are a result of your gender or race or class or age or sexuality or any of those other demographic differences that can affect how the world treats you without you having done anything to earn it. 

Just about everyone has *some* kind of privilege but obviously there are some demographics that accrue either more or bigger advantages (and if you're in one of those, complaining too loudly or vehemently about the privileges you don't have can be a very quick way to sound clueless). Often one of the big privileges for any particular axis is ""Not having to think about that kind of privilege"" - being able to ignore it because you're not being held back by your 'anti-privilege' means that it's working in your favour.

The way I've stated that, I'm not sure if wealth 100% fits the definition I've given, since wealth *can* be earned, but nonetheless there are privileges attached to wealth that go beyond just the very direct thing of having more money and being able to afford more things - people treat you and your opinions with more respect, you get to not think/worry about money so often if you so choose, you have more options and more security, that kind of thing.

I don't think I'm the one to try and offer perspective about anything, but assuming people who are better placed to do so come anywhere near this thread, rule one is to listen and remember that if they had other better options to easily fix any particular problem... they're intelligent human beings and probably would have taken them."
What would society be like if Earth were the size of Jupiter?,"If other physics supernaturally remain the same (gravity, length of day, atmospheric pressure, local climates, etc.), then what remains to be answered is ""when"" this change occurred. A secondary question is whether vertical distances (mountain heights, etc.) are likewise multiplied.

If Earth had always had such incredible dimensions, life would not have evolved in the pattern it had. For instance, the dinosaur-killing impact event would have only been a small local catastrophe rather than global.

The surface area of such a modified Earth is about 122 times greater, and linear distances are about 11 times greater. The latter number is the most important. If this enlargement occurred shortly after our species appeared (roughly 200,000 years ago), we'd probably be stuck on Eurasia and Africa.

Reaching other continents would be practically impossible. Some exception neolithic voyages occurred, particularly from Asia to Australia, Hawaii, and Madagascar, but this was done with canoes and island-hopping, often on islands that have been submerged since the last ice age. If we multiplied such distances by 11, we'd probably have never spread out into the Pacific. Likewise, although North America was once connected to Asia with a land/ice bridge, the inhospitable climate would probably be insurmountable to primitive people over distances of ~1000 miles. 

Since every kind of geography has been enlarged, humans will spent most of their lives living in one kind of ecology. People who live in grasslands will consider oceans, mountains, and deserts to be mythological. 

With such great distances between differing environments, trade will be stifled. Instead of a caravan traveling for weeks or months, it would have to travel for years, which couldn't be done with primitive means shipping goods. For instance, the stones used to make the Great Pyramid would have had to travel about 6000 miles. 

This means that if a place is going to be technologically successful, it needs to have a *lot* of geographic diversity in a compact area (so that when enlarged it's not too far to trade). This might include some islands, for instance. 

The social development pattern of humans might look something like this: Humans evolve in savanna lands in Africa, then the Earth enlarges. Early people spread around freely in this environment, never encountering anything that requires technological adaptation (for centuries, perhaps). We're therefore extremely prepared for our existing environment, but everything outside of it is alien to us. Overcoming these changes takes time, but we eventually get around to it.

Crossing things like mountain ranges and modest-sized deserts is now impossible, so humans probably spread along coasts. Ocean climates tend to be moderate, so humans can easily survive the coastlines. The Mediterranean Sea, for instance, would have a coastline of almost 500,000 miles. Likewise, rivers and lakes are massive now. The Nile will be more than 20 miles wide, and Lake Victoria and the Great Lakes will be as vast as oceans. 

Humans will have to cling to rivers and oceans much more than we already do. Traveling inland can put you hundreds of miles from a reliable water source. Since environments are basically the same under the new scale (the village 300 miles up the river has the exact same climate as yours), there's not much point in trade, and therefore little communication or innovation.

The problem is that the current system is a series of traps implemented at nearly every conceivable level. Because [schools are funded by local property taxes](https://www.npr.org/2016/04/18/474256366/why-americas-schools-have-a-money-problem), schools in poorer neighborhoods are especially underfunded, maintaining that poverty trap, and neighborhoods with people of color, including majority black neighborhoods, are [statistically more likely to be lower-income](http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/legacy/uploadedfiles/wwwpewtrustsorg/reports/economic_mobility/pewsharkeyv12pdf.pdf). Poverty and lower quality education, on average, mean that there's not a level playing field from any standpoint, including economically. Poverty correlates both with [a higher likelihood of being a victim of crime](https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=5137) and [criminality](https://www.heartlandalliance.org/povertyreport/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2017/03/FINAL_PR17_3_14.pdf) (pdf link). And, as anyone paying attention knows, the criminal justice system [has undeniable issues of racial bias which benefit white Americans and damn Americans of color](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/18-examples-of-racism-in-criminal-legal-system_us_57f26bf0e4b095bd896a1476). The so-called war on drugs complicates the issue further, because that racism in the criminal justice system extends to [disproportionate arrest, trial, and sentencing of Americans of color for drug-related charges](https://www.aclu.org/issues/mass-incarceration/smart-justice/war-marijuana-black-and-white). [There are even systemic issues in healthcare](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/racism-discrimination-health-care-providers-patients-2017011611015), resulting in significantly different outcomes in medical care based on race. 

And this is just some of the big stuff. On a less obvious scale, we have issues with [systemic racism in hiring practices](https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/9/18/16307782/study-racism-jobs), [racial segregation in religion](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/12/08/many-u-s-congregations-are-still-racially-segregated-but-things-are-changing-2/), [black Americans pay more for negotiable goods like cars](https://www.salon.com/2017/04/07/racism-in-america-its-so-pervasive-that-white-people-pay-less-for-car-insurance_partner/), and about a thousand other instances that fly under the radar for most white Americans because it's not part of our daily experience. 

Think about the scale of tackling this kind of systemic racism and discrimination across so many areas. The question as to what should be done means thinking about changing many, many fundamental aspects of American law, politics, culture, religion, education, healthcare, criminal justice/law enforcement, and individuals that it's difficult to fathom. 

So, to finally answer your question, there are a few things: 

1) **Refocus on education**. Education is the silver bullet in all of this because the old adage that knowledge is power has never been more true. I don't just mean having schools that prepare kids for college or that do well teaching math and science and art and history, but education in how the world really works. It's very easy to internalize the same lies that white Americans internalize, that black people are somehow inherently less-than, that black people are inherently more criminal, that black people are somehow responsible for being second-class citizens. That's not borne out by our best understandings of race. Race is purely a social construct, and as we understand it now only dates back about 600 years. It's made-up. There are no significant differences, innately, between black and white people. The only differences which matter are enforced through culture, and culture can and does change. That understanding is a powerful defense against cultural myths about race that people, regardless of race, can internalize without even knowing it. Focusing on the historical and modern efforts of black activists and leaders, on the very long and hard-fought battle for equality that stretches back to the early European colonization of Africa, and teaching kids about the difficulties they will face within the racist systems is a good start. 

The problem? Like I said, schools are underfunded in general, but that's especially true in lower-income neighborhoods. Teachers are responsible for overcrowded classrooms, shrinking budgets for vital materials, dealing with children's behavior which is linked to poverty, and parents are needing to work more hours because their average hourly take-home is lower, meaning less time to be with kids and be part of the educational team. 

2) **Vote, vote, vote.** The one thing most Americans have in common now that it's legal for women, people who don't own property, and people of color can vote is being part of the democratic process. Fir the first time I'm aware of, in 2012 [a larger percentage of the black American population of eligible voters voted in the election than white Americans, greater than 65%](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/12/black-voter-turnout-fell-in-2016-even-as-a-record-number-of-americans-cast-ballots/). Unfortunately, that dropped down to 59% in 2016, which I'll get to in a second. Voting is power, the power to bring about change, the power to hold people responsible, the power to overthrow the government every 2-4 years. While it is absolutely not the case that black voter turnout is responsible for the 2010 midterms or the 2016 presidential election result, it is the case that higher black voter turnout could have meant that key races went to candidates who's stated policies could have been beneficial to black Americans. Imagine if black voter turnout was above 90%, especially in key battleground states. And this is even more true for state and local elections, in which a single vote counts far more than on the national level. 

The problem? Voter suppression has made a terrifying comeback. A solution ostensibly in search of a problem, voter ID and voter purge laws and policies are making it more and more difficult for people to vote, and the efforts are clearly and undeniably aimed at the poor and at people of color. In 2016, Wisconsin—historically a state with very high voter turnout—[saw turnout return to levels not seen in nearly 2 decades because of a voter ID law](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/10/voter-suppression-wisconsin-election-2016/). While turnout only fell slightly in white, middle-class areas, it dropped significantly in districts which had larger populations of black voters. Make absolutely no mistake: American democracy is under attack, and those attacks are aimed squarely at low-income Americans and Americans of color. 

I could go on, about insisting on cultural changes in law enforcement brought about by increasing numbers of black and Latino police pushing back against racist policies, about doing the same with nursing, about pushing for a better network of legal options to fight back against racist hiring practices, but in the end I'm always going to have a ""The problem?"" paragraph explaining why these things aren't feasible. 

To put this bluntly, I take issue with the question. This isn't something black Americans can or should fix alone. Speaking as a white American, we're a fucking huge part of the problem. And I don't mean the minority of white Americans who are openly and unapologetically racist. Yes, they're shitheads and bring shame on themselves and everyone around them. No, the biggest problem is white moderates. I'll let Dr. King explain: 

>First, I must confess that over the last few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Council-er or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action;"" who paternalistically feels he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by the myth of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a ""more convenient season.""

>Shallow understanding from people of goodwill is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.""

- Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. - *Letter from Birmingham Jail*, April 16, 1963

As a white person, I can comfortably ignore everything I wrote above, in fact I'm quite certain there are vast areas of systemic racism of which I'm completely unaware. The experience of racism against black Americans is outside of my experience entirely, which means I have to not just listen when people in my environment speak to these issues but actively have to go searching for information on this. That takes considerable effort, and frankly it's an effort few if any make, even those who consider themselves advocates for civil rights and racial equality.

"Why does Communism/Radical Socialism have intellectual backgrounds, yet far-right movements do not?","Disclaimer: it has been years since I've looked into the academic side of fascism, so a lot of this is vague

I don't think it's far to say fascism doesn't have roots in political philosophers. Hegel comes immediately to mind, and many leftist philosophers are also ideologically very important in the development of fascism (ex: Sorel), making it difficult to separate their academic histories. Mussolini himself was a socialist originally. And that's not even considering that at least some fascist ideas can trace back to the classical era.

But it's also important to note that action is *integral* to fascism, that inaction is a cardinal sin to the ideology. While its brand of anti-intellectualism doesn't explicitly shun academia and there are plenty of fascists who have done a lot of writing (Mussolini was a big writer, and Strasser comes to mind), in practice it is at least a secondary focus. You see strong calls to action on the left too (ex: insurrectionary anarchism), but overall, fascism is the ideology of action, so it will necessarily be more lacking in philosophers, whereas socialism is more amenable to theorizing.

And, of course, Fascism was very young when the forties discredited it. Certainly it's not entirely gone, and there have been plenty that some people would say discredits socialism as well, but socialism arose during the Enlightment and even communism has half a century on fascism. Perhaps if it had had more history and weight, fascism would have wholly survived the world wars, but it didn't, so it was successfully discredited in a way that a group of ideologies with as much history as the various socialisms could not be."
Why do climate change deniers tend to lean right?,"Since environmentalism is generally a cause of the left (at least in the US), those on the right are predisposed to distrust environmental arguments. 

Before climate change was recognized as a big problem, there was already a strong push for pollution regulations on the left, and a strong pushback from the right. The battle lines were drawn in the 60s/70s, over things like strip mining and pesticides, which are much less clear-cut than climate change. 

Many people on the right do not look at global warming by itself, they look at it as part of a long string of environmental justifications for regulation the left has offered over the last several decades."

"Could we reach a point in the future where we know so much in a field, that no single person could even study all the necessary material to contribute meaningfully to current efforts in a field?","Coming from someone in the sciences, I think we already have. Like you said, most scientists contribute to a very narrow topic because it's impossible to gain mastery in all the moving pieces of fields like physics or biology, which have so many applications. We do have something Da Vinci didn't have, though: communication. Fast, widespread communication across disciplines is the only way to make lasting progress in a field, and I do think we are shifting towards that paradigm."

"Realistically, is solar energy technology at a point today that it is capable of becoming the primary energy source for the world? Why or why not?","No.

The real problem is energy storage. Power grids for the most part, actually generate power on demand. There aren't massive batteries anywhere that hold power to be used later, they actually have to produce more power as the demand increases.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slDAvewWfrA

In the UK they even have time the power grid with popular programs, because afterwards people all put the kettle on for a cup of tea. This is one of the reasons that fossil fuel power is so useful, because you can just dial up the amount of power they generate. 

Here you can see the percentage of power generated in the UK by type.

http://www.gridwatch.templar.co.uk/

Additionally, if by accident, the grid produces *too much* electricity, they have to bleed it off somewhere, this is not a good thing either.

So obviously the problem with solar, is that even if there were enough solar panels to power the country, it would only work in the day, and be inconsistent at best as the weather causes different output levels.

There is technology to store power (hell, you could just have a massive pump and reservoir of water that you pump to a higher elevation and then retrieve the power by running it over a turbine later on), but it's not terribly efficient. So I guess hypothetically, the technology exists to allow this, but it's not super feasible. Kinda like saying that hypothetically we have the technology to allow a person to walk across the united states if they wanted too.

The real blocker is the infrastructure, and having efficient enough technology for it to be worthwhile."
Will 4K TVs ever catch on? My thinking is that older content will just look worse than it does now.,"I work in the film industry as a VFX producer. Here's the bulletpoints to 4k tv's
  
**Cameras**
With television, there's more than just old movies and tv shows. Digital cinema cameras now can shoot at 5k (and sometimes above). As technology advances, those cameras will become cheaper and cheaper. Most new television tech gets put into sports, like HD, 3d, etc. A 4k live football game will look amazing.
  
**Conversion**  
35mm film is ~3k. 3072x2334, and most old movies are shot on 35. Unless it's shot on 70mm, IMAX, etc. Every time a new format comes out, the films are brought out from the archives and rescanned digitally. I've been in the biz for about 10 years, and we've always scanned 35mm at 2k (2048x1556) because that's the optimal resolution for most movie screens without bogging down render times and bandwidth. However, I've seen film scanned at 4k several times and didn't notice any difference, so re-scanning film at 4k is totally doable. And if it isn't for whatever reason, you can upres (or upconvert, or whatever you want to call it) digitally.
  
Now what about things that are shot digitally? The way that digital images work is they take in light and bake the image in that resolution. Most movies and tv shows are now shot at 2k or HD. That means that there's 1,920x1,080=2,073,600 pixels of that frame captured by the camera. That's it. That's all you get. Remember that to go from 2k to 4k, you're not doubling the resolution, you're quadrupling it. For every 1 pixel in a 2k image, you have to come up with 3 more in a 4k image.
  
However, with digital upconversion there are a series of complicated algorithms that basically guess what those 3 other pixels should be, by using the pixels around them. I've seen upconverted images and they look great. No problem there. Most old content can and probably will be converted to 4k.
  
**Screen Size**
Now that I've said all that, does it really matter? IMO, it depends. Clarity and resolution depend on screen size and distance from the viewer to the screen. If you took your iPad and held it a few inches from your face, it would look as good as you sitting the back of a theatre of a normal movie. So if you want to buy a huge 4k TV, and only sit about 6 feet from it, it's going to look better than HD. But could you tell the difference between a movie projected in 4k vs 2k? Probably not. I've seen plenty of comparisons between the two on a 30ft screen and if the projectionist wasn't toggling back and forth, I'd have a hard time telling the difference.
  
Also, you can see how there's a limitation on resolution. Your 60"" TV can only go up so high on the resolution chain before you don't notice a difference.
  
**VFX and animation**
This is my area of expertise. Here's a not-too-secret secret of the VFX industry; most CG is not rendered at 2k. Why? Because 1) you're probably not going to notice anyway and 2) because we're already swamped with render times. Any fat that can be cut will be cut. But that being said, what happens when images are unconverted to 4k that have CG in them? If that detail wasn't there in the first place, can the digital upconversion process fill in the blanks? The answer is maybe.
  
VFX shots, up until about 5 years ago, were always designed and approved on film. We literally had to print shots onto film (called ""film outs""), have a conformist make a VFX reel, string it up in a projector, and show the director shots on film. As more and more movies wanted VFX, more and more work was done, and more and more ""fat"" was cut. Film adds contrast and a slight blur to images, so hiding things was easy, and shots were approved with mistakes that couldn't be seen on film. Everyone thought ""hey, no one is going to notice anyway"", but guess what? Blu-ray happened, and all those mistakes became very clear. Watch the LOTR trilogy on a good TV, on blu-ray, and even with an untrained eye you can see them.
  
So that being said, some movies that were CG heavy, but approved on film, might need some touchups. Seeing them in digital HD, those mistakes may or may not be okay, but in 4k, they're really going to come out.
  
  
"
Are people getting weirder and more hateful or is the availability of instant (anonymous or not) commenting just providing the stage for it?,"I suspect you'll get a lot of responses pointing out that anonymity removes the consequences of expressing politically incorrect opinions or being hateful/spiteful and argumentative. That's right, but that's not how I look at it, because I think this is actually a good thing.

A lot of people go their entire lives harboring opinions they know are deviant or hugely unpopular. They really do have aggressive, hateful, disrespectful thoughts and opinions, but because there would be potentially severe consequences to expressing them, they don't. As a result, those opinions and feelings are never challenged. The person never has the chance to grow beyond them because they never process them.

As ugly as the process is, a person saying something unpopular on the Internet, I believe, could actually make them a better person. Of course, this requires that someone actually challenge those unpopular ideas, preferably with facts. If a forum degrades so completely into vitriol and ignorance that no one does that anymore, it just becomes an echo-chamber for ignorance.

If we want to live in a free society (with, at least, free speech), this is one of the prices we must pay. We can't (or, at least, we usually shouldn't) just keep people from speaking, no matter how objectionable their words. I think we need to patiently and sometimes repeatedly rebut ignorance with truth. To editorialize a tad, I'm much more scared of the world that might unwittingly be created by empowering a mechanism to silence those voices than I am of the voices themselves. "
Why is there a belief in society that one cannot be successful while taking recreational drugs?,"I guess for one its because those, who have their lives fall apart, cant hide their drug use as good as others. From my own experience, rich people use drugs just as much as everyone else. People in shitty conditions probably use drugs as a coping mechanism rather than socially, so it creates more habitual use and addiction and much of the issues associated with drugs.       

It can be also due to all in one bucket term of drugs. Some drugs can enhance your productivity, while some do not. Some drugs harm your physical health, some do not. Some drugs harm your mental health, some do not. Some drugs are highly addictive, some are not. And so on. We are influenced by this IV heroin addict stereotype of drugs, which is a representation of only a small and extreme portion of drug users.          

It can also be because of poor education on drugs. There are drugs that can be somewhat harmless when done right, yet highly enjoyable and beneficial at the same time; while taken wrongly can fuck you up. As such, drugs that some claim to be safe, appear to be dangerous, because someone was a moron and fucked up, and to a person who knows nothing about drugs, is enough to in validate any claims of the drug being relatively safe. And the reaction is completely understandable, after all to many this is a taboo topic, and people are cautious with unknown.             

That being said, I do not try to downplay the harm drugs can do, if you wish to experiment, research and then some more, prior taking any substance. I can definitely say that if your friend has taken a drug and seems to be fine, is not a good indicator if a drug is harmless. Some people are more prone to addiction of a certain drug while others to another.

What would happen if a successfull company paid off all of America's Student debt?,"https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/2017-09-20/see-20-years-of-tuition-growth-at-national-universities

* Colleges would fleece the next round of 18 year old freshman with sky high tuition costs. 

* In 1998, the average public university's in state tuition = $3,168, out of state public = $8,840 , private = $16,233

* In 2019, the average public university's in state tuition  = $10,858, out of state public = $26,528,  private = $43,562

* Since 1998 inflation has only increased 51%. 

*I suppose the cost of teaching math, biology and history has gotten very expensive in over the past 20 years.* 

*You'd think it be much easier to educate students in 2019, than it was when people were still using Excite.com for internet search. They call this the Information Age.*

Even if all of the debt is forgiven and the government starts paying for everyone's tuition, universities will still be charging 18 year olds sky high tuition, just now they'll be gouging the entire country for the money.  

Meanwhile university endowments grow fat with wealth and they buy up more and more local real estate with your sweet loan money.  Harvard's endowment is currently up to $36 billion, The University of Texas system is at $26.5 billion.  

I've yet to hear one politician point out that the greediest actors in this story are the universities themselves. 

Yes, loan originators are benefitting from fleecing our youth as well, but the universities got all your cash up front. They got it at 40K per student per year, or whatever they felt like charging you because only they can give the credentials that we need to get jobs.     

The Universities have all this money, right now and none of them would even think to mention lowering tuition. 

Even the very liberal Bernie Sander, who appears to have good intentions, makes no mention of lowering tuition or even making some attempt at getting public universities to justify their current tuition rates.  

All his plan mentions is preventing future tuition rate increases by certain amounts.

His plan calls for ""eliminating"" tuition and fees at public institutions, by essentially using federal money to cover the cost of tuition and fees. 

You would think in the very least that there would be some effort made to ensure that tuition rates actually reflected the actual costs of educating college students. 

No, apparently the current rates for tuition, housing, fees and a $200 Bio 101 are all perfectly reasonable just as long as they don't increase too much in the coming years. 

Every debt elimination and tuition plan I've heard of will continue to allow Universities and the related industries to make higher education as expensive as they can get away with. 

The darkest part is, how much all of this completely misses the point of simply *making the best effort we can to educate people in a way that will hopefully allow them to pursue a genuine interest or attempt to make a positive contribution to the world and ideally be able to comfortably support themselves while doing so.* 

The utter lack of new ideas, attention to detail or just any voice that doesn't parrot the same low-effort bullshit short term fix is fucking depressing.  

If libraries didn't already exist, I'm sure some  tech startup would try to turn them into some kind of subscription based ""experience"" , complete with an entry fee on special days like weekends.  Of course there would be an accompanying book sharing that you'd have to sign up for as well so that they could suck up as much data as possible while you're simply trying to learn something.   

The founder would tell us how this new service hopes to educate the world through sharing and community for only $9.99 a month (for the basic subscription)

Of course the subscription would tier based too. If you want ad-free books or to access even more ""content"", sign up for library ""Prime"" for $5 a month more.  

Here you'll find an even bigger ""library"" of material and special ""extended"" books that are actually just the original books that having been shortened for the non-prime peasants. 

Wait, there's more.  Have you ever wanted to access your books not only in your bedroom but other places as well ?  Well we got you've covered, Platinum Prime users can turn off geofencing for their 3 favorite locations !

Why do cars have top speeds of 200 kmph and above when the maximum speed limit allowed anywhere in the world is only 140 kmph?,"Essentially, you build engines with extra capacity, ~60 kmph, so that at the maximum legal speed the engines are not outputting 100% capacity which would introduce more strain on the engine and decrease its lifespan. Just like bridges have a maximum capacity, the bridge can support more than the listed maximum but past that point you will be damaging the structure of the bridge."
Settling or being alone forever? What’s worse and why?,"The thing with settling is that you are also denying the person you settle for a chance to be with someone who legitimately likes and wants to be with them. So I believe that is worse because you are ultimately denying two people happiness in that arrangement just so you don't have to face the unknown. Being alone gives you the opportunity to find your own joy in life. You don't need a significant other to be happy, actually, it is better to find someone after you already found how to be happy by yourself. "
"What could present day humanity actually do to fight off an alien invasion similar to ""Independence Day""?","Realistically speaking?

Because the reality of the situation is, if there's even the *tiniest* chance that we're a credible threat, they'll just sterilize the surface of Earth - and doing so would be absolutely trivial for aliens capable of interstellar travel.

"What is scarier, a finite or infinite universe?","An infinite universe certainty heightens the possibility of [Boltzmann brains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_brain), [false vacuum nucleation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_vacuum), and other probabilistic oddities that we would likely not be be able to observe or foresee in our timescale. 

Humans are used to having things in an orderly fashion (we *know* the Earth is round, and before that we preferred to know that the Earth was flat, but never *unknown*). The thought of a universe with no tangible ending, well beyond our observable sphere, certainty means there may be phenomenon out there we can ever physically observe or simulate, regardless of our technological advancement. 


I think the fear I have of a truly infinite, unobservable universe is derived from the same fear I have of death, dense fogs, and sitting in the middle seats on airplanes. The thought of relinquishing control of my life to systems beyond my comprehension is unsettling."

University essays often ask students to write about their greatest struggle and how they overcame it; what can someone write who has had a fairly sheltered life?,"There must be many other young people in the same boat as you. Think about what universities are really looking for when they ask such questions. In this case, perhaps they want to see how you take initiative to solve a problem and how you react in the face of setbacks. If you dig deep enough you should be able to find a struggle to write about, even if it's just the struggle of deciding what to do with your future given the opportunities and resources available to you. Maybe talk about the soul-searching and researching that goes into that.

I don't think admissions people expect every prospective student fresh out of high school to be a super-philanthrophic-wunderkind, but they want to see the potential and aspiration to be someone who achieves something for whatever cause is dear to them."

Is selflessness a great virtue? Or is selflessness a needless sacrifice of the individual?,"I would say it depends on the context of who's doing the selfless thing, their background, and the context of the situation.

There can be times where selflessness is a virtue, but there are also many times that selflessness is born out of the lack of self-respect, or being a pushover. And that is not a virtue (it isn't a vice either, but it makes you feel sorry for the pushover person)."

"Should there be an option for ""no confidence"" on election ballots?","The obvious alternative to this would be to vote for the candidate you think is best suited to making your voice heard.

A story to tell.

In 1984 (yeah, I'm old)  I was living with the parents in a rather stuffy and conservative section of suburbia.  Faced with the prospect of voting for either Reagan or Mondale, neither of whom I considered an effective candidate, I decided, in the voting booth, to pick a minor-party candidate.  When the voting results were published the next day, my district had thousands of votes for Republicans, and *one* vote for the Black Panther Party.  Fun times.

Americans, IMHO, need to get over their obsession with 'picking a winner' and start voting their beliefs and their consciences.  The two-party system works only if people continue to think that casting a 'protest vote' or voting for a candidate who is not predicted to have a chance to win is 'throwing your vote away.'

Next time you vote, vote the issues, no matter what your TV tells you the winning odds are."
Are modern companies more obsessed with profit than companies from 50 years ago or does it just feel that way?,"The thing that has changed is many cases is that people are expecting to make a profit faster.

"If polar bears are losing their habitat in the Arctic region, why can't they be bred in Antarctica, where there is much more stable landmass?","Ecologist here.

A common misconception among many people is that the Arctic and the Antarctic are very similar places because they are both regions around poles and are cold with lots of ice. Although those things are true, the two poles could not be more different; the Arctic is basically a frozen(ish) ocean surrounded by land, whereas the Antarctic is land surrounded by a frozen ocean. While that sounds like no big deal, it actually makes a huge difference in the livability of each area.   
Because of its continental nature, the Antarctic is much, MUCH colder than the Arctic, with average temperatures of -60C and 0C, respectively. This is HUGE in terms of polar bear survival - even though they have lots of fat and insulating fur, there is a limit to how much that will protect them. The mammals of the Antarctic are all marine mammals (porpoises, seals, whales) because there are no large land mammals that can survive that level of cold. 

'Adapting to a different type of prey' sounds easy to us humans because we can logically evaluate different things to see if they may be good to eat. Animals do not do this. Top predators have what's called a 'search image' when they look for prey - they know exactly the animals they can eat, and search only for those animals. Polar bears survive mainly on ringed seals and bearded seals. Both of these prey items live only in the Arctic. A polar bear in the Antarctic would look at an Antarctic Fur Seal and think 'That doesn't look like what I usually eat. I cannot eat that'. The bears would likely starve, or become extremely hungry and weak before going after something else, and by that point (especially in the harsh Antarctic) they would likely not survive.

It's also important to note the extreme fragility of the Antarctic ecosystem. Because it is such a harsh and severe area, everything that lives and/or breeds on the continent (7 species of seal, 4 species of penguin and several bird species) has adapted to just barely beat the odds on survival. Even just the accidental introduction of the common rat has absolutely devastated populations of albatross, petral, and other bird species because of predation on eggs. 

Basically, there isn't a single good thing about introducing polar bears anywhere except the Arctic. Animals have adapted to certain places on the planet for a reason, and if they haven't appeared or evolved somewhere, there is likely a very good reason for it and we humans have no business fucking with something nature has spent millions of years perfecting.

tl;dr  Different places on the planet are different.


Edit: I reread your question, and felt I should add that 'the arctic' isn't literally ice and water, and even if it was, polar bears don't JUST live in the arctic circle. [Here's](http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/islands_oceans_poles/arcticregion.jpg) a photo of the Arctic region and [here](http://www.discoveringthearctic.org.uk/images/4d_img_beargraph.gif) is where polar bears live"
How would society be different if emotions were clearly visible?,"I see several people in this discussion interpreting the results as if the change were to be overnight to all people without the benefit of society developing around the physical trait.  If I woke up tomorrow and was suddenly unable to hide my emotions from anyone, and they from me, then I suspect that society as we know it might collapse.  However, if we assume a hypothetical universe in which society developed around human-like-creatures which were constantly advertising their emotions we would probably rely on it to function.  Currently having all emotions visible would feel almost like a violation; but, in a society where unavoidable emotional expression was the norm, it would probably feel odd to not always know how those around you felt.

If we assume the ""appears overnight"" component then I imagine that makeup would become very popular for several generations until we adapt to the new norm.

We're also ignoring that we already simulate emotional and physical responses with makeup and styling, so maybe it wouldn't be as far a jump as it initially seems."

"When an “illness” is also an “identity”, to what extent is it ethically defensible to deny early medical “corrections”?","Achondroplasia has more than just external differences. There are a number of medical complications as well, enough that life expectancy is 10 years less than average.

In contrast, there’s nothing inherently unhealthy about homosexuality. Society may place psycholosocial stressors in these individuals, but society should work on that rather than preventing homosexuality.

How do you think millennial disdain for boomers will result in resentment towards the elderly on a personal level in coming decades?,"To be fair, it’s hard to volunteer your time to help old people when you’re working 50+ hours and barely scraping by. I think the reason why millennials and gen Z will not be as involved in “supporting” the elderly bc they simply don’t have the time.

Personally, I’ve seen seen boomers getting bashed on social media but not very often in real life. I have straightened out my in-laws (they’re boomers, my mom was gen X) bc they have ridiculous views on “younger generation”. They were once complaining that kids make it to college and they were so coddled in high school that they end up failing out and crying about it. I pointed out that a lot of schools now are “GPA Factories” basically meaning they would give amazing grades to okay students (giving a false sense of superiority when they enter college) and students that need assistance get passable GPAs so they can go onto college (making them enter something they are not prepared for). This all comes down to bc the boomers wanted higher property values bc “look how great our school system is! Everyone gets good grades and they all go to college!”. They were literally speechless, and bit offended, that I would even suggest they were a big part of the problem. And bc of attitudes like this it makes me less sympathetic to the aging population. I’m sure when they get into their 80s and 90s and people do inevitably help they will change their tune and realize that the problems they complain about were mostly based on the decisions they made."

Why is there not much political music right now?,"Remember that the political music of any era becomes more important and noticeable once the era is history. 

If a TV channel has a history documentary about an era, they'll focus on the music that most reflects the times, rather than the music that was the most straightforwardly popular. The music that reflects the times is often political, because the most popular music of a time is instead usually about the perennial topics - falling in love, breaking up, sex, dancing, etc.

Take 'All Along The Watchtower' by Jimi Hendrix, for example. This is one of the iconic Vietnam era songs - you hear the strains of it on TV and it's a cue that you're probably going to see footage of Vietnam and Woodstock and Nixon etc. However, 'All Along The Watchtower' was Hendrix's only top 20 single in the USA, and it only reached #20. 

In contrast, there's plenty of entirely forgotten songs that flew higher in the charts circa late 1968, when 'All Along The Watchtower' was released as a single. The last chart of 1968 features songs like Bobby Vinton's 'I Love How You Love Me', the Supremes' 'I'm Gonna Make You Love Me', Classics IV's 'Stormy' and Johnnie Taylor's 'Who's Making Love', which are all songs you typically *don't* hear in Vietnam era documentaries. 

In 30-40 years, Kendrick Lamar's 'Alright' (a fairly political song, judging by it being chanted at #blacklivesmatter marches and all) will be remembered much more clearly than Drake's 'One Dance', even though Drake's topped the charts with that song and Kendrick Lamar reached an amazing #81 in the charts."

Is the average person capable of being an autodidact?,"I think your road is harder than most, dealing with ADHD. I’m somewhat the opposite, in the group that never needed nagging to finish my schoolwork. Usually I needed nagging to persuade me to back off and not go overboard. I’ve never found it personally difficult to learn a new topic in depth—I’ll spend hours researching before buying a new toaster. Not just reading reviews and such but going and looking up what parts each one uses and what effect one part has over another. I won’t put in effort to learn something at a high level I perceive as having no immediate value but that’s actually relatively few things. If I had infinite time, I would be studying everything from car mechanics to astrophysics.

I have some speculations as to what about my upbringing wired me that way and my husband also struggles with ADHD so I’m well aware it’s not something everyone finds easy.

What cultural factors make the US far less likely to have effective protests compared to other recent examples like France or Belgium?,"It's less a matter of culture and more a matter of geography, I would say.

If France wants to stage a protest in their capitol, about as far away as you can get while still living in a major city is ~370 miles.

If America wants to stage a protest in its capitol.. well, you're pretty much only looking at relatively local people for attendance. Nobody is going to come in from the west coast as it is well over 2,000 miles away.

Couple these factors with a vastly superior transit system in France and you can see how much easier it is to reach a protest in France than it is in the US.

Why do owners of companies need enormous profits to work hard when salaried professionals in public and private sector give their best to do the job efficiently and even succeed in bringing good results?,">salaried professionals in public and private sector give their best to do the job efficiently

Of course, in politicians' case, they are incentivized by the desire to get re-elected.

>What if we switch to a system under which every individual earns a fixed monthly salary and the capital to start business is obtained from a government that is kept accountable to people by means of modern technology?

I would never, ever, ever consider starting a business in that system, and most people indeed would not.  ""Hey, would you like to work your tail off for multiple years and, if successful, receive no particular reward?""  Some people might still start businesses, but far fewer than under the current system.

>want to make this world a fair place.

The world would be fairer if everybody had the same living standard as the current world's poorest person.  But it would not be better.

A system of rewarding people who do things that society finds valuable with financial incentives has been in place for the last couple hundred years, and the result has been a larger increase in global median living conditions than was witnessed over the prior couple hundred thousand years.  Fairness is not good enough as a standalone value.  We also need to value total well-being, and recognize that some economic activities really do create value, and generate a win-win scenario for society, rather than merely growing somebody's slice of the pie at the cost of another's."

Why do patents only last 14 years while copyrights lasts at least 70 years?,">The original length of copyright in the United States was 14 years, and it had to be explicitly applied for. If the author wished, they could apply for a second 14‑year monopoly grant, but after that the work entered the public domain, so it could be used and built upon by others.

vs

>The original patent term under the 1790 Patent Act was decided individually for each patent, but ""not exceeding fourteen years"" 

>[Present day] In the United States, for utility patents filed on or after June 8, 1995, the term of the patent is 20 years from the earliest filing date of the application on which the patent was granted

So once upon a time... not so dissimilar. So the real question is why copyright has increased in length by 42 years *plus* the remaining lifetime of the author after they write the thing, while patent terms have only increased by 6 years or so.

Maybe it's Disney lobbying *hard* to keep Mickey Mouse under copyright, that's certainly a factor in the growth of copyright protection. But there are also companies that would have profited plentifully from their patents if allowed to do so, so apparently their lobbying efforts failed.

I'm guessing *that's* because inventions remaining under exclusive control of their inventor places a much more direct and obvious stranglehold on further innovation, whereas copyright only strangles the (generally considered) less important sphere of derivative cultural works; when patents are over-extended it creates a more obvious detrimental effect on the world for people to rail against."

The medical practice said they didn't do that, I would have to be induced, which I was three days after the due date. After eight hours of non-productive labor (I only dilated to 8), I asked for a section and the doc agreed. In surgery, she discovered my uterus had ruptured and pulled out a 10.5 pound baby girl (healthy). Later in the recovery room, while I nursed the baby, she told us that she knew we wanted more and while a pregnancy would be risky, it would probably be alright and they would schedule an early (a week before due date) section. My husband asked what could have happened, why was everyone a bit freaked out about a ruptured uterus. Well, the doc said, we could have lost the baby or your wife or both. My husband looked at me and told me that we had a healthy boy and girl, there was no other kind, and we were done. He wasn't prepared to lose a baby and definitely not prepared to lose me. A few years later when I hinted that I would like to try for the third, he went out and got a vasectomy. I guess he was serious. Now that our youngest is a senior in high school and we are facing an empty nest, I occasionally feel a pang for the third, but we have two amazing children who are doing and will do wonderful things in their lives and I am grateful."
"What is the difference beween ""culture"" and ""stereotypes""?","What an interesting question. Since no one else replies I might as well write something for other to disagree on. It took me some time to condense the following but here it goes:  
* A culture is a collection of practices, styles, standard and social norms that can be agreed upon within the community it applies to.  
* A stereotype is a sub-selection of cultural feats that serve to the purpose or enjoyment to someone outside of the culture. "
"Is it possible our discussions have become too dependant on empirical evidence, and as a result we're ignoring ( or under weighting) important factors that are difficult to measure?","From my perspective as a grad student in a STEM field, I think there are two main problems that relate to what you are saying. 

First, there's the is-ought problem.  Empirical science is good for telling you how to achieve a certain goal, but it's not good for telling you which ultimate goals you should be aiming for.  It can tell you how the world is, but not how it _ought_ to be.  However, sometimes misinterpret science to try and do this...the most egregious example being the social Darwinism of the early 1900's.  It also shows up today with health food and the idea that ""X is natural, therefore X is good""

The second issue is that scientific findings _always_ get hugely blown out of proportion as they migrate from the actual papers to the public conciousness.  Someone finds that one species of animal does one thing, and suddenly ""X _is_ Y for the whole living world"".  Or a test of an experimental drug is successful and suddenly ""Cure for X is found!"".   So making decisions based on the popular understanding of science, as opposed to _actual_ science, is not very profitable.

how do you distinguish between real love and attachment/comfortability?,"Based on your other comments, I’m approaching my answer from the perspective of “How do you distinguish between a potentially great relationship vs. one that’s just good enough?”

For me, I had to spend most of my 20s (I’m 31) dating different types of people and learning about what *really* does/doesn’t matter in relationships before arriving what I believe to be a great relationship with me fiancé. Personally, I don’t believe in soul mates and my views on romance are fairly grounded. I also believe there are varying degrees of love and it takes more than love to make a real relationship work. 

That being said, I think the issue I had early on and a lot of other people have is that by default we need to further distinguish what really matters to us in a relationship vs. what sounds nice. When I started dating regularly, a lot of the things I thought mattered didn’t really hold up after a while and a couple things I didn’t think were a big deal turned out to be critically important. Dating several people and having a few long-term relationships helped me sort that stuff out.

One of the things I often tell people when giving dating advice is that I can’t stress enough how important it is to know yourself, or at least try to. A lot of times we get caught in cycles of co-dependency and unhealthy attachment because we are deficient in providing that for ourselves. That blurs your vision when it comes to dating and can lead you to a place where you weren’t seeing well enough until you’ve invested significant time and feel an undue obligation to stay. While I don’t think it’s realistic to tell people they should just magically be happy being alone, I think people should at least not be scared of being by themselves for periods of time. When you don’t need someone to be your “everything”, it’s easier to focus on the stuff that makes a relationship last."
Would a World War 3 be possible in today's modern society?,"Before WW1, the common rhetoric among everyone was that the world could never be at war on such a massive scale because trade is too vital. Everyone was linked together and it is in the sovereigns best interest to not go to war because they are making too much profit. Evidently they were wrong and it really is not a big leap to say that it could happen again. How far in the future does it have to be when you have such a force like NATO in the world? I guess we'll have to see, but when it does come and you have some first world governments up against a wall, they will probably not hesitate to use nuclear weapons in order to keep their place. "
"Should we judge the actions of people in other cultures (present and past) by their ethical standards or our own? If we judge by their standards, what must we think of people who follow our mores but break those of their own society?","Good, Evil, Moral, etc.. are all, as you put it, subjective. You can look at it from so many different angles, that you it is hard to find a constant.

In my opinion, we can only judge someone, in any time period, by the closest thing to a constant we can get: What they themselves think is moral at the time of the act, by the knowledge and information that they had at that time.

For example:

* A man murders a child. Was the man evil?
* A man murders a child. The child is a serial killer. Was the man evil?
* A man murders a child. The child is a serial killer. The man did not know. Was the man evil?
* A man murders a child. The child is a serial killer. The man knows that the child was a serial killer. Was the man evil?
* A man murders a child. The child is a serial killer. The man knows that the child is a serial killer. The man was wrong, and the child did not kill the people he believed him to. Was the man evil?
* A man murders a child. The child is a serial killer. The man knows that the child is a serial killer. The man was wrong, and the child did not kill the people he believed him to. The child did kill other people, and thus is a serial killer. Was the man evil?
* A man murders a child. The child is a serial killer. The man knows that the child is a serial killer. The man was wrong, and the child did not kill the people he believed him to. The child did kill other people, and thus is a serial killer. The people that the child killed were terrorists. Was the man evil?
* A man murders a child. The child is a serial killer. The man knows that the child is a serial killer. The man was wrong, and the child did not kill the people he believed him to. The child did kill other people, and thus is a serial killer. The people that the child killed were terrorists. The child did not know they were terrorists. Was the man evil?
* A man murders a child. The child is a serial killer. The man knows that the child is a serial killer. The man was wrong, and the child did not kill the people he believed him to. The child did kill other people, and thus is a serial killer. The people that the child killed were terrorists. The child did not know they were terrorists. The man did know that they were terrorists. Was the man evil?

And so on. Every time we elaborate, or change what each party might know, we get different answers. The only thing we can judge, truthfully, was based on what the man believed, and why he did it.

To put it on another plane, you can think of it in the same light you would judge a sports trade.

The A's make a trade with the Nationals, in which the A's trade a Starting Pitcher for a few prospects.

Three years later, we find that the pitcher got injured right after being traded, and the prospects turned into average players.

Do we judge this trade as a win for the A's? A failure for the Nationals? But no one could predict the Starting Pitcher getting injured. And Prospects have such a high rate of failure, that they are a gamble.

What if the Pitcher stayed healthy the entire year, won the Cy Young and took the Nationals to the world series? All of a sudden, our view now is that the trade was a huge win for the Nationals. But all it took was a freak injury to change everything.

* Now we learn that that trade was Gio Gonzales for Tommy Milone, Brad Peacock, AJ Cole and Derek Norris. Does adding names bias our judgement now?
* What if that trade is now Tim Hudson for Dan Meyer, Juan Cruz and Charles Thomas?
* What if the trade was Mark Mulder for Dan Haren, Kiko Calero, and Daric Barton?
* What if the trade was Trevor Cahill for Jarrod Parker, Ryan Cook, and Collin Cowgill?
* What if that trade was Dan Haren for Carlos Gonzalez, Brett Anderson, Chris Carter, Aaron Cunningham, Dana Eveland, and Greg Smith?
* What if that trade was Brett Anderson for Chris Jensen and Drew Pomeranz?
* What if that trade was NOT trading Barry Zito?

So many trades that are much the same thing over and over, but with different results.

Can we judge looking back? No. The only way we can judge the trade is by the evidence, thought process and motivations by either party at the time of the trade, not anything that happens after the trade, unless it was something that they explicitly knew about.

We have to ask, If I had the same information as they did then, and only that, would I have made that trade in the same situation? Even then, to avoid Bias, you would need to judge it in a sense not by the specific players, but by the type of players that were involved (Starting Pitcher for 3 Grade B Prospects, 1 Grade C Prospect).

So to answer your question, I think you must judge that person by what they believe they are doing, not what you believe they are doing."
Why is it that humans see themselves as seperated from nature?,"Sentience. We are aware of who we are, where we came from, where we're going, and the larger implications of our actions. 

Mastery. We alone hold the power to destroy nature, or to help her along. We could nuke the planet today, if we so choose. It puts us on a higher level. If you have control over something, you don't really feel that you are simply part of it. 

Disconnect. We build things that take us away from nature. The process adds steps and makes it seem alien. Living in a large city, you can completely avoid seeing trees etc and instead be surrounded by man made structures.

"How do websites that rely on user created content (Reddit, Digg, 4chan, Tumblr, etc) attract users when they are first created?","On a speculative basis I think they gain popularity first by appealing to a niche audience.  It then grows from there.

Does life get easier after you graduate from college?,"I don't know if everyone in here had it easy as fuck in college or what, but I can definitely say it's a million times easier. Working my shitty job at full time is way better than working the same shitty job part time and being a full time college student.

I don't ever have to write papers, I don't ever have to worry about studying for tests, I don't have to worry about sleeping through a class, never getting vacations (I always worked during school breaks to save up cash, and vacation time accumulates much faster as a full time employee), having to go through monumentally painful task of choosing and fighting for spots in a class every semester, and trying to fit those classes in with each other while simultaneously making sure they don't interfere with my job.

I mean, it's a PITA that I don't have a job in my field, but life is WAY easier since I finished college, and my stress level has gone way down-even factoring in getting married right after graduating."
I find helping the G.I. Generation and Silent Generation age range with tech support vastly easier and more enjoyable than helping Baby Boomers and Generation X.

PC's were virtually no existent in my formal education. But they were introduced into my work life almost from the outset. As the ""young one,"" way back when, the older generations and older baby boomers put it on me to ""figure out the computers.""

I was basically self taught which gives you a certain level of confidence. By the same token, my understanding and methods are full of inelegant solutions and work arounds. 

It is only recently, working with millennials, that I am routinely working with colleagues who are more versed than I. So, I have to swallow my pride, not be defensive, and remember that it's about finding the right solution, not personally being right."
How do we reduce the presence of illegal guns in the US?,"If you want to reduce terrorist attacks then what you really need is widespread social and economic reform. I'm not denying that we have a gun control problem - we do - however what I am saying is that when people are sad, depressed, angry, and legally and physically unable to improve their situations then you are never going to see an end to this, whether the acts are committed by single people with guns, or en-masse with machetes and bombs.

What is the problem with our recycling system? Why can’t we switch to compostable baggies totally?,"It's not the recycling system, it's the bags.

""Compostable bags"" are  not always great for packaging. They (by design) break down when damp, don't stand up to freezing very well, aren't as gas-tight (so no vacuum/protective atmosphere), aren't always food-safe, and they aren't as strong as regular plastic. You can't shrink-wrap biodegradable bags and they're less elastic.

So, there are quite a few downsides. Most of those downsides CAN be solved, and most aren't even THAT hard, but it does require significant investment from producers, for very little financial gain, and probably even increased cost per unit.

So, we totally CAN switch, but it costs money."

What would happen if United States suddenly paid off its foreign debt?,"The actual answer is: it depends on what you mean by pay off. 

I've been a couple decades in finance, so this is the takeaway from all that time. Because of the system of currency we use, in which we have a fiat currency with floating rate convertibility, the United States as a currency issuing authority can issue net financial assets at will. It is useful to stop thinking about government obligations in terms of debt and cash as though the government needed to borrow to have cash to spend - it doesn't. It can create assets, cash or bonds, by fiat and issue them into the private sector in exchange for whatever is priced in dollars. There's very little difference between cash (a non-interest bearing asset) and bonds (an interest bearing asset) when interest rates are very low. 

When we talk about the United States paying off its debt, we could mean one of two things. First, we could mean swapping all the outstanding bonds for cash - that is, swap one asset in the private sector for another. (It is important to realize that the government's liabilities are the private sector's net financial assets.) The net effect is to reduce ongiong deficits be eliminating the need to create financial assets to pay interest into the private sector, but that would likely have a recessionary effect as it reduces interest payment cash flows to the private sector. But the net effect would not be the end of the world. Instead of the banking system sitting on piles of bonds on its asset side, it would sit on piles of cash notes.

The second, more impactful possibility would be the attempt to run persistent surpluses in government. This is not just a swap but rather a draining of net financial assets from the private sector - again, government liabilities are net private assets. This amounts to compelling the private sector to run a deficit that offsets the public surplus - and that means depression, contraction, deleveraging, the engagement of what Irving Fisher called debt-deflation. That is of course exceedingly unwise. "

"Just went through an airport security checkpoint. Why do detractors label it ""security theater"", and why is US airport security policy inherently flawed?","There are multiple reasons that airport screening is security theater: 

 - The TSA screens out ""dangerous"" items that can then be purchased on the other side of the security line, inside the airport.
 - The TSA regularly fails its own tests, with tiger teams trying to smuggle in items.  Off the top of my head, I think they have a 60-70% pass rate.  Some brave reporters have also had similar results.
 - A lot of the time-consuming demands -- photo ID, exact match of name to ticket, not saying trigger words like ""bomb"" at the security gate -- offer zero additional security.  The least able bomber would be able to pass these tests, and they _really_ inconvenience the Bob/Robert mismatches they do catch.  These hurdles are only there to convince people that the authorities are totally on top of it.
 - Studies show that looking for extremely rare items -- like a gun -- is difficult for humans to find, in hour after hour of common items.  Will they get that water bottle in your backpack?  Hell yes.  Will they spot the knife?  Probably.  Will they spot the gun or the explosive?  No, not often.
 - Prior to the 9/11 hijackings, passengers were passive.  A hijacking was best survived by laying low, waiting for the plane to go somewhere and have the hijacker's demands met by authorities.  Post 9/11, a _large_ majority of passengers would be willing to fight to the death.  When Richard Reid tried to detonate his shoe bomb, he was detected by an alert flight attendant, who basically said ""get him!"" to the other passengers.  They completely subdued him.  This pattern of incident has been repeated several times.  (Mostly with mentally unstable passengers, granted.)
 - Entirely inconsistent rules applied at different airports.  If they were important rules, they should be uniform rules.

"Pro-choice people: If a procedure existed that could transfer a fetus, would it still be ethical to allow abortions?","In certain circumstances, I'm sure abortions would still be ethical. For instance, if the fetus were morbidly malformed and could not survive on it's own ever, there would be no point in a transfer.  On a personal level, I hate the idea of abortion but given the overpopulation of the planet and the fact that most of us have a detrimental impact on its state of health, I believe that abortions are actually quite ethical for those who want them. Just as legal/assisted suicide may be compassionate and responsible in some ways as long as there are no more merciful alternatives for those who are suffering so severely. This is a very sticky issue though - ""we"" are not sufficiently enlightened or knowledgeable about ourselves to allow too much leeway in matters like this - it wouldn't take much before we were living in a very callous state and deciding that certain ""types"" or ""mutations"" should be terminated and to generally have little value placed on life resulting in forced or planned euthanasia, abortion, and why not bring back executions too for good measure?"
It was recently announced JPMorgan Chase will be fined $0.92 billion for trades made fraudulently and in bad faith. Losses in shareholder value amounted to $4.4 billion. Can someone please explain this?,"For this specific case, the payout to the SEC is just the [beginning.](http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/09/19/in-jpmorgan-settlement-testing-the-lines-of-admitting-wrongdoing/?_r=0)

Generally, the settlements reached don't actually have the banks admitting they did anything wrong. In this circumstance, it seems slightly different so there will definitely be future suits against JP coming up. 

The reason most cases end up settling for less has to do with how lopsided the funding of these investigations is. The banks toss everything at them and the SEC is understaffed to ever take it to court. Hence settling for pennies on the dollar to at least reap some benefit. "
What degree of commitment should a healthy friendship have?,"Healthy friendships seem to develop naturally from a mutual respect for one another. I think that when you respect someone and want to be friends with them, it doesn't require that much effort to do the things you both enjoy.

Unfortunately, I'm still trying to figure out the why that healthy balance is seemingly so much more difficult to strike in romantic relationships.."
Why have prices for services such as health care and education risen so much over the past fifty years?,"For education I think its partly due to the nature of how student loans work. The government made it so there is a very low barrier to get student loans, so that anyone who wanted an education could conceivable have access to it--a good idea. However there were compromises made to mitigate risk on the behalf of the lender.  Its very little risk for a lender to loan the money to the student. The debts are very rarely discharged, meaning bankruptcy typically does not effect them. Also the benefit of increased income due to high education makes it even more likely to for the lender to get payment.

Subsequently there is a surplus of money on behalf of the student allowing them to seek education without too much regard for cost...at least in the short term.  Universities have taken note and increased prices because people will pay for it regardless.

California state universities just got busted for this. They've been caught drastically increasing tuition over the years even though there is a billion dollar surplus in the system...So a bunch of students are essentially paying for the university system to ""profit""."
Why working 12+ hour days is valued over working shorter but more productive days?,"For a lot of work, it's difficult to precisely quantify in advance how long it ought to take, so unless you're constantly watching over your employees' shoulders it's hard to tell the difference between someone slacking and someone running into unexpected complications.

Time spent at a desk is easy to measure and a very approximate proxy for effort invested. Plus spending long hours at work demonstrates ""dedication"" even if you're working slower than you theoretically could."

Why is it so socially awkward to greet old acquaintances in public?,"A little bit of an oversimplification, but I think it gets my idea across.

Basically, people can be put into 3 groups: friends, acquaintances, and those you have never met.  Friends you are presumably close to, and so no awkwardness occurs when you see them.  You have plenty to talk about and you are comfortable with one another when you are not talking.  

For people you've never met, you can fall into your standard ""meeting people routines.""  You've subconsciously (or maybe consciously) come up with a few common things to say when you are getting to know people.  What school do you go to?  Any siblings?  What is your job?  etc...

But acquaintances fall somewhere in the middle, and it is here where I am the most awkward.  I'm at the point where I've usually gone through all the little small talk-y things (or at least enough that I don't want to risk repeating myself), but have not spent enough time with the person to have a ton of experiences in common.  We have no in-jokes and we know very little about the other person, so even though you feel compelled to have a conversation (because if you didn't that would be rude) you don't know what to make it about exactly.  Maybe you don't remember some of the little things they said from last time.  Or maybe you just didn't like them very much last time.  Whatever the reason, you aren't at the stage were silence is comfortable, but you aren't at the stage where casual conversation is comfortable either.  "

What are the risk of USA becoming an failing autocratic state ?,"Of course there is a risk of the U.S. becoming a failed state by some definition. That was always a risk. I suppose the question is whether or not the U.S. has already become a failed state.

I want to describe two modes of evaluating an institution. The first is in its stated goals. The second is in the measured outcomes that the institution actually creates. The United States government, and any government for that matter, can be evaluated under these modes. The United States constitution, and all of the subsequent legislation and legal precedent, can be used to describe the stated goals of the state.

The outcomes are much more difficult to measure. It is difficult to measure what is an outcome specifically tied to those precedents (the U.S. constitution and subsequent legislation and legal precedent), and what can be measured as an effect of people's individual actions, the chaotic nature of life and reality, etc.

I want to point to a couple sources of corruption in our current systems. The first is the Citizens United ruling by the Supreme Court. I'm sure most people are aware of this ruling and its effect on our politics, but for those who aren't I'll summarize it here. Citizens United is a ruling that, generally speaking, allows corporations to donate limitless sums of money to political campaigns, and that money is protected under the first amendment, as free speech.

The outcome of this ruling is basically to legally condone the purchasing of legislative influence over our government. Our legislators are to one degree or another beholden to their donors, and in some cases the influence is total. That is one mechanism by which corporations exercise influence over government.

Another source of corruption in our government is regulatory capture. I'm sure most of you reading this are familiar with the phrase, but for those who aren't, I'll describe it generally here. Regulatory capture is a method to circumvent the founding principles of regulatory bodies. For example, a regulatory body such as the Environmental Protection Agency was founded in response to egregiously dangerous business practices that were having a large, and detrimental impact on the environmental systems that we rely on for our own survival. Business practices like dumping toxic waste and manufacturing byproducts into riverways, which poses a very real threat to health and wellness, both of people and other species, plants and animals.

Regulatory capture happens when an agent of those polluting industries, which become fed up with the higher cost of complying with the regulations of the EPA, take positions of power within the agency, and exercise that authority to loosen the restrictions put on the industries the EPA was founded to regulate.

Both of these problems are massive, and require serious, dedicated action to correct. In the example of the Citizens United ruling, it is going to require, I believe, 35 states to ratify a constitutional amendment, or it is going to require a case be brought forward to the Supreme Court, and the Justices there would have to overturn the previous decision.

I wrote all of this off the top of my head, and I think it's important to mention that this is my understanding of the situation, and I could very well be wrong about the details. If I am wrong, it is not my intent to spread misinformation, and in that vein I am open to critique and correction. The gist of my post, however, I believe is on point."
"What factors have lead up to the UK voting leaving the EU (""Brexit"") and what potential results can be expected?","As far as I can tell, from within the UK, there are a number of factors that led to the vote.

There was a working class dislike of the free movement part of Europe, which was viewed as taking jobs from English people. The same force regarding Mexicans that has driven so much support to Trump. Globalisation doesn't work for everyone.

The working class press was very much pushing for Brexit, using the free movement issue above all. They were doing it for their own self interest. Murdoch didn't like the fact that he couldn't push around the EU like he could UK governments.

A political vacuum around the right-wing, working class vote gave space for UKIP to spring up. The party drove the issue initially and prompted Cameron to promise a referendum as a campaign promise to stop losing voters from that demographic.

Cameron made bold statements about getting power back from Brussels in return for him campaigning to remain in the EU. Unfortunately, the deal he managed to get was incredibly weak, and even those small concessions were threatened to be vetoed by the EU members, as the EU didn't take the possibility of Brexit seriously.

Factions within the conservatives supported Brexit as a means to secure power, knowing that Cameron would have to resign."
Is it wrong to contribute nothing to soceity?,"As long as the person is appropriately consuming resources (ie. not stealing or actively harming society by over-consuming) and there were taxes paid on the income that is being used to support him (not on welfare or disability), then I don't think that there is anything morally wrong with being a NEET."

The cop was polite to him and let him go.  This kind of thing happened a lot to him.  Asian friend was going 5 over on a deserted street, driving a 15 yr old Toyota.  Cop pulled him over and ticketed him.  Then the cop asked if he was on drugs and made a comment about his pupils being big.  He had black eyes, it's impossible to tell and he doesn't do drugs.  Cop demanded he let him search his car, keeping in mind my friend had been extremely polite and respectful to the cop, was barely speeding, and has never been convicted of any crime.  He let the cop search his car, the cop found nothing, but continued to harass my friend.  He finally let him go and said that he knew my friend was doing something wrong but couldn't hold him any longer.  This was not the first time an experience like that happened to that friend. 

I know this is just one anecdote and not a universal experience, but this kind of thing happens all the time.  And then statistics show that black males commit more crimes than any other group (percentage wise at least).  Part of the reason for this is profiling; when you're only looking for one type of person, you will find one type of person.  

This, understandably, creates a lot of anger from both innocent and guilty black men (as well as sympathizers, which can consist of any demographic at all).  And then something like the Zimmerman fiasco happens.  A half-white man with a white last name makes an assumption about a black teenager and the teenager ends up dead.  It doesn't matter what the other details of the case are, some of that anger that so many people have is going to spill over into this case.  Does that mean Zimmerman was a racist?  It doesn't matter to them; it's just another example of a black person who paid the consequences of profiling.  

And that's not to mention how black people live in a society where most TV and film stars are white, heroes are white, presidents are white, congress is white, etc.  Black people are told by our media that they are criminals, bad fathers, lazy mothers, ignorant and stupid.  Similar things happen to women, LGBT, and fathers but in different ways.  They have a lot of resentment built up over years and years, and the Zimmerman trial was an example of an opportunity to let some of that resentment out.  "
Is there a huge maturity difference between 18 and 20 years old?,"I don't think age matters as much as experience.  Most US 18-year-olds live with a parent, attend high school, hang out with the peer group they grew up with, work only part-time.  Many 20-year-olds in the US have at least at some point lived independently in an apartment or dorm, gone to college classes, have broken away from their peer group and formed new associations, and have at least worked a forty-hour week for a couple months.  Even that small taste of adult life can make a huge difference in attitude and outlook.  Were the societal disruptions to a person's life to happen at a different age, the apparent maturity jump would happen differently too."
"Why are young adult women more ""closed off"" with strangers than young girls or middle aged women?","Yeah, it's 100% a safety, learn-as-you-go type thing.

What advantages does a dictatorship have over a democracy (assuming the dictator is not a tyrant and actually cares about the country) ?,"Dictatorships are very efficient. From an economic standpoint, decisions can be made without a lot of red tape, and a single, consistent vision can create stable long term policy. Contrast this with democracies that every 4 years are undoing laws they just did 4 years ago, or are embarking on a brand new policy that undermines the long-term goals of the previous one.

Dictatorships can also affect more long-term social change as well. Because there is less room for dissent, a dynamic, powerful leader can get past the normal obstacles of change. Look at the US where we passed Obamacare and then spent the next 8 years fighting about repealing it--in a dictatorship, not only would it that back and forth not happen, but the dictator could also improve the problems and make it even better than it is now.

A good example from history, interestingly, is Saddam Hussein. When he first came to power, he crushed any dissent and ruthlessly seized power, but he also led Iraq into an era of great prosperity. The economy boomed and his moderate Sunni faction ushered in a time of great social progress. Women were able to dress in western clothes and attend college, and Iraqi colleges were some of the best in the Middle East. Iraq throughout the 70s was a great example of a stable, progressive, and prosperous Arab state.

Until 1980, that is, when Saddam made the terrible decision to invade Iran, which turned into a military and economic disaster. Iraq went from being one of the richest and most stable states into one of the poorest, which caused a series of other desperate moves including invading Kuwait. Saddam was a very interesting man because showed the great strengths and severe weaknesses associated with dictatorships."
How do you deal with the sometimes depressing reality of working life?,[deleted]
"Has all the ""deep"" media we've consumed and forgotten about made us better people?","You said it yourself. Although we forget the essence of things, you ""remember"" your view being altered by things you have read in the past. While you might not be able to recite the plot, reading things that are 'life changing' imparts value on the reader. It shapes who they are. 

So yes, although I'm no philosopher, if the book once did change you to be a better person, there's a 90% chance the effect is ongoing. It's 2AM and I'm on my phone, but look around. We are all individuals nuanced in our identities. While we are conformist to an extent, people don't revert back to a generic persona once they forget something that changed their opinion. We read, we learn, and our individuality is constantly shaped by our experiences. Although the specifics are often lost with time, identity is a constant - and the deep media we have consumed has imparted on our subconscious, shaping us to be better people."
What are the national delusions in your country?,"Argie here. For some reason, everybody in my shitty, fucked-up, utterly corrupt, still-developing-after-all-these-years country thinks Argentina is some sort of major world power. I think these hilarious delusions stem from the Peron years (late 40s, early 50s), when unions were really strong, industries were blooming, and the exports were, for once, comparable to those of First World countries.
It really pisses me off that such stupid mentality still thrives among the Argentine people, considering the current situation the country is in.
Everywhere we go, people hate us because of our over-inflated, pointless egos.

"If the U.S. constitution was torn up and they had to make a new one today, what would come out of it?","We could end the two party system by switching to a ballot where candidates for single seats are ranked in order of preference.

Why do so many people believe that punishment is better than incentive ?,"Punishment seems like a very primal urge we have. Someone wrongs you or the comunity, you kill, mutilate or shame them. For some reason that is gratifiying for us. Harsher punishments are always popular with the general public. 

Also it's easier, locking someone up or hanging them is easier than providing education, reintegration and prevention programmes. Goodluck trying to get funding for ex-cons or economically disadvantaged youths. The public will say you baby them and that punishments aren't high enough. 

Forgiveness clashes with this urge to punish and hurt. "
What turned out to be the logical explanation of what you thought was a paranormal experience?,"About a year ago, there was a couple month span where I would be lying in bed, half asleep, and I would be roused by furious scratching on the wall above my bed. By the time I would fully wake up, the sound was always gone. I was starting to be seriously freaked out. I thought my apartment was haunted, or at the very least there were animals in the walls.

Around the same time, I would frequently be kept awake by shouting arguments outside the bar below my apartment. It was while I was listening to one of these arguments that I realized one of the shouting voices belonged to my brother, who lives in LA, and who couldn't possibly be getting in an argument outside my apartment in Wisconsin. At this realization, the shouting immediately stopped and I woke up.

I realized that I had just been experiencing very vivid auditory hallucinations during the onset of sleep. After that night, I have not heard the scratching, or the arguing in the street."
How can we get out of the negativity trap and stop finger pointing?,"Well, I actually think that this post is a good start (for me at least). We need to discuss this with peers and friends *when* it happens and take it from there. Start with small things (Facebook mocking, celebrity finger pointing) and work your way up to a more generalized attitude change over time. Because this is such a common way to act nowadays it's key to start small so people don't turn on you immediately and tells you to get off your high horse or even worse sees it as you finger pointing the other way. 

I've been working on the same approach with casual misogyny and attitudes towards gender roles and it's hard but I believe that if you do it consistently and in a calm matter it can change you and even others too.
 
Just like talking about the weather it's used as some sort of common ground and bonding between people you don't know too well or have just met. These first impressions are crucial and we need to address this with more understanding.   "
What would you do to change the US education system?,"One thing school teachers could do is teach students about the sort of research that goes on at college. There are some amazing projects going on, that would really get kids interested in math and science.

And that was only by accident really."
"Art is clearly subjective, but is it so much so that there isn't such a thing as unquestionably bad art?","If you're using the generic term 'art', then no.  

If you want to say ""this is a well written book"", or ""this is a poorly written book"", then that is ok.  Both the good book and the bad book are still 'art' though.  

There are certain rules within every medium that can't really be broken without turning into a bad example of the medium.  A book with no words and no pictures, just 300 solid black pages, is a shitty book no matter how you want to try to define it.  You can, however, break any rule and still be art.  One could easily call that book of black pages art."

If you feel you can't get ahead except by cheating, you will tend to cheat.  If you feel like most people don't cheat, you will try to expose cheaters.  So: education of how to spot and report corruption, along with strong enforcement.

Are we in a new 1930' area ?,"This is interesting question and I wish I could give you a more historical answer. I think we're actually a ways of from what the world was like in the 1930s. For one the global economy, especially in the developed world, is doing quite well. In the 30s, much of the world was experiencing a financial slump. The misfortunes that this caused gave reason for people to call on autocratic leaders in the hope that breaking the static quo would fix matters. 

This actually makes our time period quite unique. It's not as clear why their is such a demand for autocratic leaders. If I were to wager a guess it's a response to globalization and the extremely rapid development of technology in the last two decades. This has frightened many conservative groups and older generations that have not been able to keep up. Unfortunately, this also happens to be the majority voting group in most countries. 

 I would be surprised if most people who voted for autocratic leaders actually understand who they're voting for. They don't see the individual as autocratic. So I'm not sure if people are intentionally turning away from democracy."

What will it actually be like when the U.S. student loan bubble collapses?,"i've been in finance for 20 years, through a handful of burst bubbles and crashes, and -- while i have a healthy respect for bubbles -- i challenge a lot of what appears to be the conventional wisdom in the housing bubble aftermath that the student loan bubble ends in the same way, or even (all due respect to Mark Cuban) ends at all.  i've yet to be convinced of the avenue for a true crash.

what made the housing bubble so devastating in 2007 and 2008 was that the loans being expanded to support house price growth were being created in an off-balance sheet system of special purpose vehicles that would issue commercial paper (CP) and other debt instruments to fund large baskets of loans.  because of the way those instruments were tranched and then insured ('wrapped') much of them were issued as AAA securities, enabling a massive restricted capital pool (insurance, pension, banks, etc) to buy them. 

key #1 in this is who was doing the wrapping -- at that time, private institutions called monolines that carried sterling reputations but very little capital reserve. key #2 was that the loan performance could be drastically affected by feedback from the price of the asset -- it was not widely recognized or modeled that deteriorating loan performance could spark capital flight and a national coordinated decline in housing prices that would further deteriorate loan performance. (even though that had happened many times before....)   such a large feedback loop could destroy the monolines quickly and precipitate a disaster.

student loans are not entirely like that. key #1 is that, while plenty of capital is flowing into making student loans, the loans themselves are overwhelmingly wrapped by the United States federal government -- the investors are going to be made whole regardless, as the thing comes pre-bailed out even in the event of a wreck.  that dramatically reduces the possibility of a wreck because capital has very little reason to fly away.

key #2 also doesn't hold -- the price of the asset is the long-term value of a college education, and that is not going to decline even if the loans stop coming.  even with tuition where it is, college still represents a sterling investment to the student -- the families are going to keep coming for new loans.  and the loans themselves cannot be discharged even in bankruptcy (unlike with housing, where you can in most states mail the keys to the lender and walk).  that eliminates the feedback loop that wrecked housing.

on the one hand, there's no doubt that many kids are being saddled with lots of debt in return for spurious degrees of questionable value.  but that in and of itself is a more sustainable model than one might wish to believe -- mostly a matter of adjusting interest rates.  for a true crash to materialize, there has to be a mechanism capable of that kind of volatility.  one of the reasons student loans have become such a center of loan growth is that the financial system recognizes the absence of that mechanism.  

that's not to say it can go on without limit.  things like the [Sweet Briar capitulation](http://www.businessinsider.com/sweet-briar-college-closing-2015-3) are evidence that students are getting more cost conscious.  but tuition and fees at Sweet Briar for undergraduates were also in excess of $50,000/year for a liberal arts education that is socially desirable but otherwise difficult to monetize.  that's far from foretelling the end of higher education."
"Hypothetically, what would happen to the cartel if all drugs were legalized and regulated?","The cartels would move to other organized crimes activities and/or ""pirated"" drugs.  

In Mexico the cartels have begun relying more and more on extortion and racketeering as the drug trade has become more complicated and thus less profitable.  

Also, anytime there is a market for high regulated ad high cost goods there is a market for unregulated low cost alternatives.  Cartels could make a profit by selling knock off drugs at lower prices.   "

Do you think alcohol will ever become not a part of our society as a whole?,"No. We have already tried to remove alcohol from our society once, and it was a massive failure. The only way it won't be part of our society is if it falls away naturally over time. Given that alcohol usage is pretty much as old as history itself, I'd say that there is a very good chance it is never going away at this point."
Anyone who has had a spiritual awakening what was your experience like?,"I am an ex-drunk.  I spent the better part of twenty years pursuing the life of a party hound.  Not the best life-decision, but I had my share of fun, despite scrapes with the law and other setbacks.  I thought that folks who spent their years grinding away at a job and enslaved to their responsibilities were dumb.

I finally had enough and sobered up.  Hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life.  Was definitely not feeling the love from that process.  Sorting though the detritus of a twenty-year slack-fest was not my idea of fun.

Anyhow, several weeks later, I was driving home from visiting a friend, Labor Day weekend.  I rounded a curve and right in front of me was a sobriety checkpoint.  Flashing lights, orange cones, officers in uniform, lines of cars waiting to get through, the whole deal.  My brain started spinning a million miles an hour, and I frantically started processing my options, how to turn around, what kind of evidence might be in my car, lies I could plausibly tell the police, all of the usual checklist of last-chance options a person of my caliber is used to going through when things are about to get hairy.

And, then I realized, *I am a free man*. I am not drinking.  I have nothing illegal in my car.  I am not breaking the law.  I do not need to evade the police.  I am heading home, not downtown.  So I waited my turn, rolled through the checkpoint, and down the highway towards my original destination.

My epiphany was this - *freedom was not what I thought it was*.  I had always looked at 'freedom to"" as the ultimate goal in life - freedom to do what I wanted, freedom to break rules as I saw fit.  I had never, until that event, looked at ""freedom from"" - freedom from fear, freedom from guilt, freedom from worry, freedom from the need to hide from the scrutiny of others.

I was, in that moment, able to re-interpret all the actions of the last twenty years of my life in a new light.  I had discovered a crucial piece of missing information that allowed all the other bits of evidence to fall into place.  Years of failure to achieve my dreams were explained.  The freedom I had wanted all my life was incomplete, and therefore false.

I had always assumed that a spiritual awakening would include flashing lights - I just didn't expect them to be blue!"
Is it possible to improve without feeling really unhappy about yourself?,"Very few people tell stories about gradual improvement. And even fewer people will give a shit or pass on the story. Don't be fooled by what you see on social media being reality. It's highly filtered to show you the most dramatic and/or impressive stories.

I'm very happy in my life, I have a good job with decent pay, a husband, and a house. I'm still going to school at night, trying to read more and avoid TV, eat healthier, focus on being active and going to the gym, etc.

And you're probably already nodding off hearing about it. It doesn't sound exciting. Who cares if I'm going to the gym three times a week instead of two? I do, and that's all that matters. Motivation has to come from inside. You have to care about yourself as a person and do better because you want to be better."

What economic impacts will coronavirus have?,"Well most recessions are triggered by stochastic events and I’d consider this a stochastic event since no macroeconomic model is able to predict “sudden virus pandemic”. 

Just for definitions sake a **recession** is defined by 6-18 months of stagnant or negative gdp growth while a **depression** is 18 months or more. 

So whether or not this becomes a recession / depression depends on how long this lasts. Assuming it does last for a long time it’s within reason that this could cause a recession/depression. 

Hopefully legislators will try to enact safety nets to prevent some of the significant economic issues such as lost wages due to no paid sick leave."

I think what you are going through is normal within the rhelm of grief. When you experience such an important and hurtful loss it's normal to feel some days you are back to zero.

Holidays, special occasions can trigger this feeling and it's common, you aren't crazy, you aren't losing it, but this is what grief feels like and even though it sucks, it's how it is.


You lost an important person in your life and it will take time for you to heal enough to not feel these anxiety symptoms about it. How long? I don't know, most people are different however specialists say that a grief process can take between 2-3 years.

I don't know if you have someone to talk with about this. Its important having someone that can listen, either a friend, a priest etc that can be useful however I recommend you to talk to a professional like a grief counselor.

I also think that can be useful for you to talk in  a support group for people that lost their partner. Grief can be aggravated when we lose people all of a sudden, like in an accident, instead a long illness. A support group, even an online one could help you a lot.

"Why do people actually care if people don't fit into traditional gender constructs (such as men being girly, women being manly?)","I think it boils down to people don't know how to react.

How hard is it to actually live a life illegally in a country?,"Depends on which country we're talking about. East Europe has lots of illegals from Ukraine, Russia and the Far East, like Vietnam. They rent an apartment illegally and usually work in construction, where they get paid in cash. It's generally not a big problem as those people just want to make some money to send home to their families. 

I don't think it's very hard once they get a job, as all the necessities can be bought with cash. Troubles start if they get injured or something like that, because they're not eligible for free healthcare services. 

A few years ago one construction company refused to pay their vietnamese employees for the work they've done. He said ""What are you going to do, go to the police?"" They did, won the lawsuit, got paid, then left the country. "

I feel like youre not looking for guidance so much as validation. Flirting is not hard to distinguish from sexual harassment. You don't have to bring up sex at all to flirt FYI, and a basic understanding of body language and social cues will let you know if the other person is enjoying it. "

>The first-sale doctrine creates a basic exception to the copyright holder's distribution right. Once the work is lawfully sold or even transferred gratuitously, the copyright owner's interest in the material object in which the copyrighted work is embodied is exhausted. The owner of the material object can then dispose of it as he sees fit. Thus, one who buys a copy of a book is entitled to resell it, rent it, give it away, or destroy it. However, the owner of the copy of the book will not be able to make new copies of the book because the first-sale doctrine does not limit copyright owner's reproduction right. 

So from a legal perspective selling a used CD is protected by the first-sale doctrine whereas uploading the contents to a p2p network would be considered 'reproduction' and be prohibited."

Who should we listen to for a long-term strategy for beating coronavirus?,"American philosopher Charles Peirce suggested a 4 level typology for arguments:

1- instinctive (more or less arguing without thinking)

2- a priori (""we've always done it that way"")

3- authority (""because I say so"")

4- inquiry, scientific or otherwise (""I have been or I am still doing the research"")

What's interesting is that it grades the value of arguments: authority is not bad per se, it's just not as good as having done the inquiry yourself. 

So you can rely on people if you have reason to believe their comments are based on sound inquiry, by themselves or others. 

Public figures have more exposure, so they should be careful with what they base their comments on.

From that point of view, I would trust Gates more than, say... , Trump or Pence (which reminds me: religious arguments are based on authority, but can never be backed by inquiry/scientific research, which is why they should have less weight...).

Edit: spelling"
Is the media irresponsible with the constant sensationalism?,"Yes, the media probably is 'irresponsible', but then one must question whether it is incumbent on the media to be responsible in the first place: should that actually be part of their job? 

If so, then who gets to decide what is and is not responsible - and indeed what is and is not 'the media'? Should we only have government approved media, and if so, how far from current government policy can they stray before they are considered to be fear mongering and corrupting the youth?"
"Why doesn't the United States military use measured force to intervene against the cartels in Mexico, alongside the Mexican Army?","Because after conquering half of Mexico we then later supported back to back coups (forcing a guy into power and them forcing him out of power) in quite possibly the absolute stupidest foreign policy move of all time. After Mexico recovered, they specifically wrote it into their constitution that they're not allowed to invite foreign military intervention."
Do you believe that suicide is a cowardly act?,"People don't choose to be born, life is forced upon them, sometimes accidentally and sometimes intentionally. The world is full suffering and pain and people are forced into it. If someone wants out, why would that be considered cowardly? It obviously is the easy way out of suffering, but so what?

It's unethical to conduct a scientific experiment in which harm may come to participants. Participants are always encouraged to quit the experiment if it ever becomes uncomfortable. We don't refer to these quitters as cowardly, and we certainly don't try to prevent them from trying to quit an experiment that can be beneficial to hundreds and thousands of people or even themselves. Yet when it comes to life, we force people into it without consent. Parents who willingly have children do it out of selfish desires. Parents who accidentally have kids are restricted from abortions. 

Society is responsible for the suffering the people are trying to escape from. Society is responsible for forcing these individuals into the world without consent. And yet, society has the audacity to even consider that suicide is cowardly? Seems like an incredibly egocentric viewpoint to me. "
Is it possible that the budding marijuana business could finally motivate the apathetic 18-35 year old base to vote in 2016 and beyond?,"While I think the stigma surrounding marijuana is becoming more and more lax each year, I don't think it would be large enough to unite us all. Not all of us smoke, if you can believe it lol. (I support the taxing and distribution of it, and acknowledge that it's a lot more safe than what we were taught to believe back in middle school, but I don't smoke.) 

And while, yes, we do have a history of not voting, I think this year will be the year to finally push my demographic into the booths. The thought of having a billionaire hotel mogul in the white house is terrifying, and Trump currently has an enormous opposition in my demo (18-28). That alone seems to have been enough to get people involved in the process and get passionate about government in general. "
Why are chemical weapons considered to be the 'line in the sand'?,"Chemical and biological weapons are potent and indiscriminate. They blanket death and destruction upon soldiers and civilians alike. Further, they frequently trigger a long, tortured death process. Lastly, they are ruinous to the land and can easily render an area uninhabitable for some time."
Isn't there a more effective way to express dissent or demand change than protesting in the streets?,"Stop buying shit. When it comes to companies, people can write strongly worded letters & even picket all they want, but until a large number of people boycott the company's products & hits them financially, they really don't give a shit. Idk how applying this method to government (large percent of the population not paying taxes) would go, though. "
Why are Suicide rates highest in countries that recieve low amount of sunlight?,"Being exposed to sunlight makes the brain release more serotonin, which is a hormone that helps regulate mood, sleep, appetite (amokg others). Decreased levels of serotonin is a major cause of depression. During darkness, the brain also emits another hormone called melatonin, which is the hormone that makes you sleepy. 
During the dark winter months many people experience a lack of serotonin and increase of melatonin, which is why Seasonal Affective Disorder (also called winter depression) is a thing. I myself live in Northern Europe, and usually struggles a lot in the winter.

"What would the US look like now, if 9/11 have never happend?","Without 9/11, I think in some ways we might have a more peaceful mindset as a country and we'd be less jingoistic and polarized than we've become. We've also taken on the mantle of a vengeful victim, something that is always much clearer to me every year around this time.   


9/11 helped accelerate the growth of a fissure in US. That fissure has now turned into a full blown division between american citizens. There wast time that you could discuss politics with people on the other end of the spectrum and it wasn't likely to devolve into a screaming match. It feels like that's much less true now."
What is wrong about facebook selling our data to other companies?,"We are undergoing a propaganda attack unlike anything we’ve experienced in this country in our lifetimes, and it’s working. Facebook is not only the enabler, it’s been found to be an agent, or at least knowingly complicit.

Cambridge Analytica is using cutting edge technology and tactics to manipulate voters with false and misleading information. They have also been exposed in potentially illegal activities to blackmail candidates. Facebook has a physical presence in their offices. They are actively enabling their agenda.

So, if you use Facebook, or any of their subsidiaries, your view of the world is being warped by a massive and sophisticated propaganda machine."
Should a person who owns a private business be or not be able to decide whoever goes inside based on whatever criteria they choose?,"Imagine racism is prevalent in a particular community.  Every business selling mattresses refuses to sell to people of a particular race.  Because racism is prevalent, those of that race cannot buy mattresses anywhere.

Sometimes society will not self-govern to remove x-ism.  In such a case, it falls upon the government to force removal of x-ism.

This is why, for example, the US Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and why the Supreme Court ruled in *Heart of Atlanta Motel* that the Civil Rights Act is Constitutional.  If business owners can select their clientele, then the Civil Rights Act should not have been passed; blacks in the deep south should continue to be disenfranchised; and government should stay out of society.

But there are groups of people in the United States who are protected classes due to the empirical evidence that they will be discriminated against in society and relegated to becoming second-class citizens--unless the government interferes.  And so the government *should* interfere to prevent society from degrading into one of castes.

Your argument is to leave choice in all matters to the business-owner--but this is a non-choice if the community pressures the business-owner to act a certain way through indoctrination or boycotts.

From a values standpoint, equity/equality trumps individual freedom, for without equity/equality, there can be no freedom, but without freedom, there can be equity/equality."
What's wrong with political correctness?,"The devil is in the details, of course.  There is absolutely nothing and completely everything wrong with ""PC"" depending on context.  

PC, in general, is a fucking fantastic thing.  Like, not using a cultures' name for getting ripped off (Gypped, Jewed), not treating gayness as either other or lesser (lol fag, thats pretty gay, homo), those sorts of ""just be a decent person ok?"" things are pretty damned reasonable.  If PC is solely about not being an asshole, then why are people so salty?  

Because the question you asked was ""what's *wrong* with political correctness"" I'm going to be focusing on negatives and criticisms much more from here on in.  That there are positives and clear winning points doesn't really need elaboration or belabouring.  

Before I go there, though: there's a *massive* range of different greys here, nothing is black or white, and two slightly different versions of PC will disagree on a wide range of things.  The critics hold all applications of PC to its worst and most extreme examples, while proponents similarly defend the whole practice using the best and most reasonable examples.  This makes conversations around the idea really confusing and generally quite charged, because the two sides are talking about nearly completely different versions.  

The ""real"" answer as best as I can figure is somewhere in between and tends to get overlooked because it involves far more maybes and grey areas and context than makes for fun and easy soundbites to rally behind.  

In many cases, PC doesn't believe in context or nuance, and when those things are accounted for, the allowance is nowhere near as liberal as others might desire.  Take the word ""fag"" - we can all easily and reasonably agree that it's not an appropriate word for describing gay man in, say, a news article.  It's generally not a word you'd use at high volume in a crowded room full of strangers.  There are a lot of clearly *inappropriate* contexts for ""fag"" but *are there any contexts it's acceptible, permissible, or reasonable*?  Like, is it reasonable for me to have used it twice in the span of this paragraph?  

What about ""in private""? Is ""private"" a thing, is it actually an extenuating or excusing context?  I think back to high school, when we used to crack very racist jokes around our lunchroom table.  We were the only people who had that room, and we were a group of 12 or so kids who looked like a trite stock photo of ""diversity,"" we were comfortable we weren't racist. To us, the joke wasn't that Jews have pointy noses, or Chinese people do math - the joke was that there are people who actually believe this ridiculous shit.  But there's no way a stranger or a fly on the wall or what have you would understand that.  They'd just think we the most diverse KKK meeting out there; we didn't understand that someone unaware of our intent would be hurt or offended, because we didn't mean it ""like that"".  

But there's a whole lot of complexity we didn't understand.  That jokes might normalize attitudes or provide ""latent"" racism a place to lurk and grow escaped us, that we were giving voice to attitudes society shouldn't have at all escaped us, that what we *meant* wouldn't prevent us from hurting someone walking by never even occurred.  If ""private"" is an excusing context, what is ""private enough""?  

Context gets worse, or at least messier, as we delve deeper though.  Should context excuse gay communities attempting to reclaim and destigmatize ""fag"" as a term?  Similarly, black people using ""nigger"" or ""nigga"" to refer to each other or in cultural artifacts like music or literature.  Those same terms make other people from the same group exceptionally uncomfortable and even may still make some of the in-group uncomfortable if used by the out-group, like straight people or whites.  How black is ""black enough"" that using slurs or attempting to reclaim them is ok?  

I'm these words ""meta"" if you will, as a word that is an example, not as a slur in and of itself.  But to some people, even using it to discuss itself is insensitive and hurtful and inappropriate - think how for instance American news media almost always refers to [""the n-word"" rather than ""nigger""](https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/n-word-vs-cracker.jpg).  

So when you have a group that believes some words should never be used at all for ""PC reasons"" - this gets hella messy with both terms, just as some gay communities are reclaiming ""fag"" and some black people are comfortable using ""nigga"" referring to each other, other members of those same communities are intensely uncomfortable with those terms being used at all.  

PC easily gets used more as ""word police"" than a system of values promoting not being an asshole.  If some black people or some gay people are uncomfortable with the terms that used to exist commonplace slurs, do all of that group also lose any rights to use it?  Does everyone?  

A really fantastic example of this is a recent decision to publish a version of Huckleberry Finn that has every instance of ""negro"" or ""nigger"" replaced with ""slave"" - despite the fact that the book itself is a historical artifact that's similarly using the term as an artifact in dialogue in the course of establishing a cultural setting alongside the geographical one.  Or even more appropriately To Kill a Mockingbird was condemned by some Canadian school boards for using ""nigger"" in the course of what is widely regarded as an instrumental piece of literature for the Civil Rights movement and an all around condemnation of racism.  Their concern?  That the word's use would make some students uncomfortable, in spite of its context.  

In this vein, PC treats word policing as one and the same as solving the underlying issues.  It is far more important to use the right words than have the right attutude, in this case - it's possible to present exceptionally slanted or even racist content without once using any of the ""bad words"" that PC is concerned with.  

An example here I've always loved was people with metal or cognitive disabilities - ""retards"" - and our childhood usage of the PC terms around the playground as slurs.  The real issue of course *should* have been that a bunch of kids were using an innate status (something someone else has no choice in as part of their identity, like race, sexuality, or disability) as a slur.  Like, it didn't matter what the word was, using ""disability"" as an insult was bad.  But what we understood then was that calling people ""a retard"" was bad, the correct term was ""special needs"" - so next time they were ""special"" rather than retarded.  The intent was still there, the harm to both subject and status was still there, we were just using the current word.  

A lot of critics see this side of PC and quite reasonably see this as substantially selling short the complexity of the issues it attempts to tackle.  But that is holding PC to perhaps an unfair standard: ""if it's failing to solve racism completely and utterly, why bother at all?"" At its core, PC isn't necessarily trying to solve those things.  It's a much simpler goal of ""we can't fix the underlying issue, but we can reduce the ability of these attudes to directly harm their victims and even a little bit is good enough"".

Which conveniently segues into the last big criticism of PC, which is that if allowed absolutely free run to its most absurd extent: it intends to make sure no one, espcially from a marginalized demographic, is ever uncomfortable.  

No one can ever be offended, hurt, or slightly marginalized by anyone else's expression.  Language is forever playing keepaway with needing a way of saying ""disabled"" or ""black"" or ""female"" without providing a term that can ever be used against or taken harmfully by that group.  In order to ""be PC"" one has to take into account each and every marginal perspective and be prepared to adapt on the fly to fix any semantic misstep in order to better accommodate this or that hypothetical victim.  People who dislike, fear, or criticize PC are often very afraid of being seen as racist, or worse, labelled as racist, simply for not sanitizing their language adequately.  

They may *be* racist.  Don't get me wrong, it could be true.  But most of those folks don't think they're racist, and don't understand the complexities of modern race politics well enough to understand things like latent or institutional or systemic prejudice.  In fact, most of those folks understand racism is bad and being racist is worse and that is why they're so afraid of the label.  Because they know it's bad and don't want to be bad.  

But the last big objection to ""PC"" is the one I give the most weight to: it's used as a placeholder.  

Rather than explain why telling racist jokes even when you're not racist might still be harmful and bad, we hear ""it's not PC.""  Rather than discuss the complexities of the word ""nigger"" and the black community's relationship with it, we just learn ""its not PC"" for white people to use.  

By simply replacing argument and discussion with ""PC"" or ""not PC"" we're skipping over the most important part of asking people not to use a given term.  We tell kids ""fag"" isn't PC and don't use it, so they use ""gay"" instead rather than learn that using someone's sexuality *as* an insult is bullshit and stupid.  By almost viciously labeling and shaming offenders, we set people who honestly probably *want* to be allies on the defensive, we craft an us vs them conflict and automatically seed them in with the racists and homophobes, while confirming to them that the racists and homophones were right when they complained about ""everyone just being too sensitive"" "
"When does your ""life"" really begin?","A lot of people have some problem with this threshold, for what it's worth — and I'd go so far as to say pretty much everybody does. Cognitive dissonance is normal for young adults who know they're probably an adult in the eyes of the world but who don't feel like a significant change has happened. (Sure enough, the exception seems to be people who experience an attendant major *external* adjustment to their place in the world and their responsibilities — baby at a young age, death of parents at a young age, etc.. In the category of 'people under the age of twenty-four-or-so who feel like an adult,' you tend to find a lot of people who were ""forced"" into adulthood… or at least that seems to be the case for these past couple of generations.)

Furthermore, it’s worth pointing out that the majority of the people who feel this kind of a disconnect during their young-adulthood do, in fact, go on to experience “feeling like an adult.” Sometimes it takes a while, sometimes it doesn’t, but... just take that with you, as you continue to ponder this issue. It’s overwhelmingly likely that you will resolve your philosophical conundrum on this matter, even if you don’t have kids, even if your parents never die; you’re not going to feel like a child forever.

But, wait — all of these old people saying they still feel like a kid at heart. What gives?

Excuse me while I divert you for a moment; I’d like to share something about the world that is only tangentially related. Have you ever noticed that you can, somehow, *always tell* that an old dog is old? It’s just something about the way they walk — it’s not even necessarily that they’re slow or in pain, it’s just that they just carry themselves a bit differently. I think the subtle cue that we’re picking up on is actually something about what they’re *not* doing, which is that they’re *not* becoming alarmed or curious about every little thing that they don’t understand. They’re kind of unflappable. They walk down the sidewalk, some foreign sound happens right behind them, and they don’t reflexively flinch… in fact, they casually glance back, like “hm?,” and then continue as they were. In the same scenario, a puppy might be more excited: “hey! what was that!? something happened! hey, owner, did you hear that!? did you hear that something happened? what was it? what happened? hey! what did that sound mean?”

Here’s the salient point of that observation as it relates to your question: it’s *not* that the old dog isn’t still a puppy at heart. If he’s hanging out on the floor, lying down, chin on his paws, and you walk up and make eye contact… boy, that tail is gonna start thumpin’ real quick, and he can’t wait to start whatever adventure you two are about to set out on. That old dog is puppyish as all get-out, at heart. He has lost none of his **capacity** for excitement and curiosity and love… it’s just that, after a while, he realized (deeply, reflexively) that he doesn’t have to deploy full-power to all of those things for every little stimulus that happens to him. He’s adjusted his **threshold.** He’s absolutely a puppy at heart, but… if there can be such a distinction, he’s not really a puppy at mind.

So, back to the humans, and to an older person telling you that they’re a kid at heart, and what gives.

They’re not lying to you, but you might be misinterpreting what they mean. You hear them make a claim like that, but you still just *know* that you’re experiencing the world differently, so you reply, “sure, you *say* that, grandma, but I can plainly see that you’re not as crippled by the thought of filing taxes as I am” ...or, “sure, you *say* that, grandma, but I can plainly see that you’re not as fascinated by this philosophical insight as I am,” or whatever. 

You are right about experiencing the world differently. You and she do mean different things when you report feelings of kid-ness. She’s reporting an available option: she has the capacity to feel like a kid, and often does — where you’re reporting an unavoidable condition: you can’t seem to feel like anything *but* a kid. As such, from your point of view, she’s in a pretty priviledged position; she doesn’t experience the problems you do in your kid-ness, she just gets to cherry-pick the good stuff like wonder and simplicity and excitement. She’s not saddled with your deep strains of existential panic about everything you don’t know.

...and, hey, that’s just puppies not knowing what all the sounds are yet, y’know? That’s just old dogs having already spent the time to learn what not to get stressed out by. That’s just getting older. That’s just points on a spectrum.

Unless some external thing changes in your world and you suddenly have to adopt a critical responsibility for yourself or for others, there is no moment where adulthood “clicks” on. There is no moment where your “real life” begins, and your “old life” ends. This isn’t a platitude, this is the no-shit truth… unfortunately, it’s a truth that a kid can’t be helped by. Knowing that you will eventually know more things is not the same as knowing more things. You don’t benefit from that knowledge. You will still be forced to experience the dreadpanic of ignorance for a *bunch of stuff,* but that’s only because you haven’t done (or haven’t gotten used to) a *bunch of stuff* yet.

That’s actually all I had to say, but to conclude this wall of text with one last rumination — you know how old people say “youth is wasted on the young,” or “boy, if only I could do it all again knowing what I know now?” Take a moment to consider what they *don’t* mean. They don’t mean that high school history class would have been easier if they already knew about the Renaissance, or that buying their first car would have been easier if they already knew how loans worked, or… whatever. That's probably true, but it’s not their point, because who gives a shit. They’re not saying that they wish their teenage self had the benefit of more knowledge, they’re saying they wish they had the benefit of more wisdom. They’re saying they wish they could bring their modern “adult”-ness — their “old-dog”-ness, their finely tuned set of filters for what simply doesn’t fucking require getting stressed out about — back into childhood and adolescence with them, because imagine how much *joy* one could experience in those years if they simply knew what not to get distracted by.

Also, as an aside, it’s people with some amount of this very perspective who are urgently telling you that your life is already happening and to stop worrying about questions like this. Myself, I think you're right to worry about questions like this.

...for a while, at least."
How was it to live in 1980's USA?,"I was in my twenties in the 1980's, so I was then, about the age of most Redditors now.

More then anything to me, it was an age of cynicism, posturing, greed, and hedonism.  And I was right there along for the ride.

When Ronald Reagan won the 1980 election, the country was in the depths of a collective national funk.  Nobody had any faith in the political institutions of the day, the economy was sputtering, and America's prestige worldwide was at a low ebb.

The dreams of both the Great Society and the Woodstock hippies had collided and dashed each other to pieces during the seventies, and the emotional exhaustion was palpable.  Nobody had won, and the sense was that the cultural disconnection between the older and younger generation would continue indefinitely and cripple the nation.

Reagan, you must remember, was not a heroic-looking figure back at the beginning.  If anything, he appeared to be a washed-up second-rate movie star, the oldest elected president ever, and, outside of a fringe group of right-wing zealots, was viewed as a bit of a crackpot and a potentially unreliable hand on the nuclear 'button' during the height of the cold war.

Within a couple of short years, Reagan had managed to effectively end an inflationary spiral, and, through a leadership style designed for maximum television exposure, had re-invigorated the American psyche.  This, of course, came at a price, although we didn't see it at the time.  

While I truly believe that Reagan's intent was to exhort people to be industrious and optimistic, the actual result of both his policies and persona was to unleash a wave of young, greedy, amoral Wall Street yuppies, while WWII-era elders were given tacit permission to disengage from economic and political life, and reap in ever-increasing government-sponsored benefits, far in excess of the contributions the put into the system.  

Elders continued, nominally, to hold the reins of power, and give a veneer of respectability to the process, but younger, less scrupulous, shamelessly ambitious anti-hippies swarmed out of Middle America and into the centers of finance and government, set the cultural tone of recklessness into high gear, and the Reagan Revolution was on.

Geez, you pushed one of my buttons.  I'm waxing poetic about this crap and I haven't even got past 1983.  Gotta go, comment if you want more."
There are many who claim that the Earth is more abundant than we realize and capable of sustaining upwards of around 40 billion humans with wise implementation of the sustainable technologies that we currently have available to us. How do you feel about this notion?,"There are speculations about the Earth's capacity being around 40-50 billion people. But there is another point to be considered here.

Current population could not be supported without some of the technologies that have been invented in last couple hundred years such as artificial fertilizers and industrial manufacturing. Similar methods of sustaining larger populations may reveal themselves along the way.



Another interesting topic is; 

There may be a point in the future that we decide that any other life forms living on the planet are trivial. And then we will perhaps just index and keep records of genetical data and let the species go extinct in order to have the place for ourselves.

This sure sounds selfish. But even today, many environmentalists will argue that we should protect the ecosystem as it has a vital role of allowing **us** to live. And when it is certain that a life support system can be achieved solely using man made environment, I believe we will have a serious discussion about sacrificing biodiversity on the planet for our needs. 

Perhaps we will still have zoos and museums as conservation of interesting species. But unfortunately, I don't see any other scenarios at this point."
Why are so many people who are pro-Gay Marriage against incestuous gay marriage? Don't the same arguments apply?,"Realistically the reason is probably simple prejudice and stigma, but that doesn't mean that there isn't a legitimate reason to treat homosexual and incestuous marriage differently.

The most obvious is that not allowing homosexual marriages prevents homosexuals from ever marrying someone they are sexually attracted to. This is a much bigger cost to them then ruling that people cannot marry one specific person they are attracted to, since presumably they could find others. Additionally the interest in incest (whether it be societal or not) is extremely low, meaning there is little impetus to change it for the few who desire it.

Finally, and most importantly, there are significant costs to incest that don't exist for gay couples.

I posted this in response to another similar question. It is two major harms to incest that don't exist for homosexual marriage (I removed the genetics point). 

>1) Incest creates unequal relationships that are prone to abuse and issues of consent. Families are not a group of equals. Even between sibling there are significant differences in authority (older-younger sibling dynamics) but this is especially true for parent-child dynamics. It is questionable whether any consent given from a child to a parent can ever really be considered non-coercive. In the same way that the law protects against other coercive relationships (therapist-patient or teacher-student for instance, it makes sense to protect people from this. Gay relationships on the other hand are of equals who can freely consent, not necessitating any government protection.

>2)Incestuous relationships eliminate the safe space of the family. Our society is highly dependent on the structure of the family. It is where we learn our values and are generally socialized to be part of the community. Introducing a sexual dynamic inside of the family structure, opens up families to problematic dynamics such as hostility and insecurity. I think we can all see the problem of having children fear that they are the target of sexual aggression in their own homes and that their parent is merely waiting for them to turn eighteen to sleep with them. Since all reputable studies indicate that the children of gay parents do no worse than the children of straight parents, this type of argument cannot be likewise used against gay marriage.

"How do you know whether someone is your ""true"" friend?","Actions speak over words.

This has held true to time not only just for friends, but for anyone that is deemed to be trustworthy or not.

In the case of friends, it's safe to say that a friend is someone who truly does care about you and more likely, than not, will go out of their way to do things for you because ""that's what friends do.""

Real friends rarely flake, rarely make excuses and genuinely LOOK FORWARD to hanging out with you, they don't find it a chore or bothersome.

You learn from having shitty friends. Everyone goes through that cycle and that's what prompts you to look for better qualities in the next person you meet.

But what I feel a lot of people overlook is the fact that the type of friends you HAVE, reflect YOU as a person. Everyone makes a shitty friend or two during their lifetime, but when it starts becoming a cycle, you need to take a step back and really look at yourself. The qualities you seek must be reflected in yourself first. But you must also keep those qualities strong and steadfast, you have to be consistent with who you are. 

Don't be a doormat, but don't be too pushy with others either. Human ethics is too broad of a topic and is another discussion for another day, but overall your friends reflect who you, yourself are. And not every friend you make is going to be perfect, either. That's why it's trial and error, and also how you really come to trust and rely on those if they can do the same for you. "
"Do you draw a line between animals that you refuse to eat and animals that you have no qualms about eating? If so, where is it, and why do you draw it there?","I care very much about animals and wildlife.  I also enjoy hunting.

It's important to be aware that your meat requires something to die.  I don't enjoy the killing aspect of hunting, but I do appreciate that the killing causes one to be mindful of one's food and have a personal, intimate connection with the animal.  

It's kind of illogical to use intelligence as a determining factor in what it's ok to eat.  Suffering is suffering.  Saying that there's an intelligence threshold is just rationalizing away the suffering of one's prey.  I wonder how many of these people eat pork.  Even ""dumb"" animals deserve dignity.

There are a few types of animals I probably would not eat for practical reasons (foul taste, diseases, etc) but I don't get the objection people have to eating things like horses.  I probably wouldn't eat dogs or cats because they are scavengers and would either taste disgusting or carry disease.  Similarly, I wouldn't hunt/eat coyote or cougar.  

Surprised nobody has mentioned insects.  I don't know if I could eat insects, the very thought of it is repulsive.  If we could get over that, insects would be an economical and environmentally-friendly way of getting protein and could easily replace a lot of meat consumption."
Does the Ebola outbreak in Africa pose a real and serious threat to western society or is there an air of media sensationalism surrounding it?,"As the CDC just announced:

>There is no significant risk in the U.S. While it is unlikely that the disease would spread if imported into the United States, the recent infections in U.S. healthcare workers working abroad highlight the need for vigilance.

[This NPR article](http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2014/06/25/324941229/could-the-ebola-outbreak-spread-to-europe-or-the-u-s) might be of interest:

>So should Europe and the U.S. begin worrying about the virus?

>""The chance of Ebola spreading out of West Africa is very, very low,"" says infectious disease specialist Kamran Khan, with St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto. ""But if it did spread, Paris is probably the first city on the list.""

>Even if that happens, the odds of fellow passengers catching the virus are extremely low, says Dr. Mark Gendreau, who specializes in aviation medicine at Lahey Medical Center in Peabody, Mass."
Soldiers of Reddit: What is your attitude towards Remembrance Day?,"Veteran here, been through the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq. Veteran's day is a crock of shit. A day for people to wave their Chinese made flags around and applaud a group of people before forgetting all about them the next day. Country music singers do their thing, jets fly over stadiums and people shed fake tears at national anthem's sung nationwide. Meanwhile, the suicide rate among veterans is sky high, the medical and mental health care for veterans sucks and we have a government who leaves our guys to die in places when they get attacked (see Libya). Want to support veterans? Vote all these ass-hats out of office, stop attacking every country in the world and quit pretending you fucking care if you don't. I volunteered for the military. In other words, I signed papers without anyone putting a gun to my head. It was my choice and I don't need special thanks for the choices I made. Can't wait for this day to be over. "
How do (personally) decide what information sources to trust?,"Reliable information is hard to find, but you can check off a positive and negative list whenever you see a news article:

- Is the headline hyperbolic (overexaggerating) and full of heated, 'scary' looking buzzwords? If so = bad.
- Does the article come from a news source that has an international presence and a long reputation for being honest? If so = good.
-Does the article have named eye witness testimonies or links to primary sources of information? If so = good.
- If it's science or medicine related, does the article have scientific proof (a link to a peer reviewed journal article)? Read the article. Does the article contain the same info as the news report? If so = good. 
- Does the article appear one-sided? Is it blaming a particular group of people, or trying to make you scared of something? This is fearmongering, and is bad.
- Does the article use multiple Whatifisms? (literally, 'but what if...') These phrases are designed to confuse readers and push ideas that have no relevance or proof. They are bad.
- Is this news, or opinion? If it contains personal pronouns (eg: I think... Seems to me like...). Biased personal views = bad.

Things to look up after reading a news article:

- Who owns this website/TV station/newspaper? Do they have a known political agenda? Is itlikely that what you just read/saw has a strong leaning based on the owner's personal affiliations?
- Who is the author of the article and what else have they written? Do they have a notable reputation in journalism?
- Fact check yourself: if you tried to investigate the same issue, can you easily find proof that the article's report contains real facts?
- Does the TV report or newspaper headline feel like it's trying to 'grab' you (eg: clickbait) or actually inform you? 

It's hard, really. But searching yourself for multiple sources and articles, other than sticking to just one for all your news, is often they way people avoid becoming trapped in a biased cycle. Keep in mind, if the report was real, multiple sources would be publishing it. If it's isolated to one channel/newspaper, perhaps it's not all that reliable..."
Why has being transgender not received the same acceptance as homosexuality/bisexuality?,"There are a number of factors at work. Changing genders is harder to understand/accept than liking the same gender. Billy Bob is still Billy Bob even when he comes out as gay. It just is another thing to know about Billy Bob. Billy Bob becoming a woman is not Billy Bob anymore.

People probably know someone gay. That helps. Transgender people I believe are a much smaller minority.  So, people dont met them as often and they suffer from medias interpretations and peoples wild imaginations."
"The Catholic Church has said that Climate Change is real, humans are a major cause, and it is our moral imperative that we try to stop it. With that in mind, is their stance of anti-abortion and anti birth control contradictory to their moral imperative why or why not?","First of all, the initial premise is flawed.  While it is true that Pope Francis has asserted that climate change is real and that humans are a major cause of it, even choosing to enshrine this ideology in his encyclical Laudato Si, it is in no way a part of the infallible magisterium of the Catholic Church.  Catholics should heed the words of the Holy Father in Laudato Si and be more diligent to care for the environment, but there is absolutely nothing novel being put forth in the encyclical which requires the assent of divine faith.

Even assuming that it is binding on all the faithful to accept that it is our ""moral imperative to try to stop climate change"", there would be absolutely no contradiction with the Church's stance on abortion and contraception.  The Church does not call us to protect the environment for the sake of the environment itself, but for the fostering of the dignity of the human race.  Abortion - the taking of an innocent life - can be justified by no means whatsoever.  The Church has always taught this and always will.  The idea that because the Church is advocating more responsible care for the environment makes her stance on abortion and contraception contradictory is nonsense.  The reasons Catholics are called to care for the environment is for the benefit of humanity, for God has given mankind dominion over the environment.  The Church would never condone the taking of innocent life to protect a lesser good - namely the environment."
Do you believe there would be a United Earth in the future?,"A lot of responses to this post have missed the point.  Not only is it inevitable, but it's happening already.  Statistically, the number of polities has trended downward as we become more economically interdependent.  In a traditional sense of borders and boundaries, we see new nations form all the time (South Sudan, most recently), but the fault lines of economies are distinct and will not yield to new order anytime soon.  The world is flat.

Not only is the world flat, but we are currently living in a era of unforeseen economic cooperation.  None of this would've occurred without new technologies that untapped the power to bring earth to heal and to knee: coal, petroleum, nuclear energy.  

Each time humans invent new technologies that give them greater control over their environment, they create new problems in the process.  Climate change is one unfortunate externality of fossil fuel mastery.  In one sense, this could be the thing that unifies us, but only when that peril begins to **directly** disrupt the complacency of modern consumers.  

Along the axis of time, fewer and fewer separate polities exist.  By some estimates, we have gone from 10,000 proto-states at the turn of the Neolithic Revolution, to now around 200.  This trend will continue, but probably not in the traditional sense of borders and boundaries.  Russia understands this well, and is trying to fight a battle below the barrel of a gun, in the trenches of political economy and cyber warfare.  But they've isolated themselves in the process, subjected to harsh sanctions similar to Iran.

Before we see a United Earth, the world will need to be flatter, and we'll also need to face a common threat, be that climate change, ISIS, etc.  "
"Redditors who have friends of different cultures, races, colors, religions, creed, etc. What have you learned from them that made your life better and vise versa?","I have a Dutch girlfriend and lived in the Netherlands for a while. The Dutch value directness above everything else. They like to always tell the truth, and see little white lies like 'that dress looks amazing on you' as meaning that you don't actually like or care about somebody. I have learned to be open and honest with people I like, and to tell them what I think straightforwardly. I'm still English though so I don't go quite so far as to seem rude. 

Living in Egypt I learned about generosity, but also about how to continually fend for myself and to interact with a ridiculous number of people daily. I was given dinner ('iftar', the evening meal after the daily fast in Ramadan) by people who could themselves barely afford to eat. I was brought dinner by the low paid office assistants when I had to work late, and invited to eat with them even though 90% didn't speak English. I also had to learn to avoid being scammed though, but to exercise patience since most of the people trying to hustle you are just horribly poor and see you as a way for them to be able to eat that night. 

In France I have learned the value of good living. What's the point of working 60 hour weeks when you don't get to enjoying your life? Drinks after work, good food, relaxation, they are essentially the point of life and working. Don't live to work, work to live. "
Is being funny a learned skill?,"I've taken improv classes and even run a workshop or two. Here are some thoughts.

Comedy is hard. It often looks easy, but it seldom is.

""Don't be funny"" is one of our rules in improv. In general, people who think they're funny and do some kind of schtick are terrible at improv. Of course, there are different forms of comedy. Nevertheless, I find it funnier when people aren't being jokey but playing it straight yet absurd.

We train a lot in improv. And the training makes us better. There are certainly skills that can be honed. Timing is one of them, and timing is very, very important in comedy. 

Another guideline we have is that the improv works best when it comes from a real place. There's a personal element, or at least something that other people can connect with. This guideline also holds true for humor in general, I feel.

In the end, I would say that... yes, you can practice, train, and improve on humor as a skill. But before you train, you should develop a good mindset and attitude. Read about schools of improv to understand what that might mean."
