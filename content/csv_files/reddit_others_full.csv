"One Piece Summarized, took 30 hours. Can you find pandaman?",I didn't think anyone could summarize the entire story on a page. I was so wrong.,"

Pandaman can be found in the One Piece manga and anime series. He is a mysterious character who often appears in the background of certain scenes, usually in a crowd of people. He is usually seen wearing a black and white striped shirt and carrying a red umbrella. Pandaman is a fan-favorite character and has been featured in several official merchandise items. He has also made cameo appearances in the video games based on the series."
"You saved some of the treasure, right?","Zoro making a run for it and taking Sanji with him, before Nami goes Super Saiyan on Luffy's ass! 🤣🤣","

Yes, I did save some of the treasure."

Is it real ?,That's naruto's last chapter. Oda paying respect to kishimoto as the naruto saga ends and kishimoto with the nod.,"

That depends on what you are asking about."
Here we are! When did you started reading/ watching One Piece?,I probably started in ‘04 watching the watered down 4kids dub and after some years without seeing it started reading the manga in 2011 and the anime in 2017,"

I started reading One Piece in 2001."
What did luffy mean by this?,Idk but this maybe like top 3 moments for me,"

Luffy's statement likely means that he is determined and confident in his ability to achieve his goals, no matter how difficult the challenge may be."
"One piece has been the only anime in my entire anime career to make me feel, and cry. This part where brook had to watch all his crewmates die one by one but still kept on singing breaks my heart. What are some of your guys favourite scene that made you love this show?","Be sure to comeback, Sanji. Without you, I can't, I won't become the Pirate King.

Also, when Luffy saved Vivi from Crocodile.

Vivi : Luffy, my voice isn't reaching anyone.

Luffy : Don't worry your voice is heard by us.","

One of my favorite scenes from One Piece is when Luffy and Ace meet for the first time. Seeing the two brothers reunite after so long and Luffy's determination to save Ace from execution is a testament to the strength of their bond. It's a powerful moment and one that really stuck with me. Another favorite scene is when Luffy and his crew arrive at the Sabaody Archipelago and are surprised to see the Thousand Sunny in the harbor. It's the first time they've seen the ship since they left the East Blue and it's a reminder of how far they've come and how much they've achieved. It's a moment of both joy and pride that I really enjoy. Finally, one of my favorite scenes is when Luffy and his crew battle Kaido at Marineford. The sheer scale and intensity of the fight is incredible and Luffy's unwavering determination to protect his crew and fight for what's right is truly inspiring."

Each Straw Hat best scene (anime only). What are your thoughts?,"For me for Luffy it's punching St.Charloss, Nami saying, ""Luffy, help me!"", Sanji it's between him telling Luffy he want to go home to Sunny or standing on the table looking down at Judge, for Brook it's him facing down Big Mom solo declaring, ""Young lady, what fool makes his death as part of the plan?""","

1. Luffy's declaration of war against the World Government in Marineford - This is an incredibly powerful and emotional scene that sets the stage for the entire series and shows Luffy's unwavering determination in the face of overwhelming odds.

2. Luffy's rescue of Ace from Impel Down - This scene shows Luffy's incredible strength and courage as he charges through hordes of powerful enemies to save his brother.

3. Sanji's Vow to Zeff - Sanji's vow to his mentor is a heartbreaking yet inspiring moment that shows the strength of his character and his loyalty to his friends.

4. Zoro's Duel with Mihawk - This intense fight between two of the strongest swordsmen in the world is a great showcase of Zoro's skill and determination.

5. Usopp's Speech to the Arlong Pirates - Usopp's inspiring speech to the Arlong Pirates is a great example of courage and determination in the face of overwhelming odds.

6. Nami's Return to Cocoyashi Village - This emotional scene shows Nami's courage and strength as she returns to her hometown to confront her past and make a new start."

"Mihawk : ""Aren't you gonna use your slingshot?"" Usopp : "" I'm not stupid enough to use a cannon to hunt a rabbit""","When Mihawk earns his respect, he'll finish him with the rubberband of doom","

Mihawk is surprised at Usopp's intelligence and understanding of the situation. He is impressed by Usopp's understanding that a cannon would be overkill for such a small target."
Why are you not backing away from the stab?!,"""I am the world's greatest swordsman and you were tied to a pole at marine base a few days ago, you never had a chance, THINK Roronoa, THINK!""","

I'm not backing away from the stab because it is a serious situation and I need to protect myself and others from any potential danger."

One of my favorite panels with a lot of drawings in it is the scene in the Naruto manga where Naruto and Sasuke fight for the last time.

The entire page is filled with detailed drawings of both characters, as well as a beautiful background that really adds to the atmosphere of the scene."

"[DISC] You Boys Love These Sorts of Things, Right? - Oneshot by @kmyk_243",Guys only want one thing and it's fucking ~~disgusting~~ expensive:,"

Hiroshi glanced up from his desk in surprise as the door to his classroom opened. He hadn’t expected anyone to be coming in this late in the day, and he was even more surprised to see a girl standing there. She was tall and slender, with long black hair cascading down her back and a pair of glasses perched on her nose. She was wearing a simple white dress and black heels, and her expression was one of determination.

“Hello,” she said, her voice a little louder than necessary. “I’m looking for a group of boys that might be interested in something a little… different.”

Hiroshi felt his heart skip a beat. He knew exactly what she meant. He had heard the rumors about the underground club that held secret meetings in the basement of the school. It was said that they did all sorts of things, from playing strange games to experimenting with drugs.

Hiroshi had never been brave enough to join them, but he had always been curious. He had also heard that they were looking for new members, and he thought that maybe this girl was here to recruit him.

He cleared his throat nervously. “Um, yeah… I might be interested. What kind of… different things are you talking about?”

The girl smiled. “Well, it’s a little hard to explain. Basically, we do a lot of things that other people wouldn’t understand. We experiment with our minds and our bodies, explore our desires and our fears. We push the boundaries of what’s considered normal and acceptable.”

Hiroshi felt a thrill run through him. He had always been fascinated by the idea of pushing the boundaries, and he was intrigued by the girl’s description.

“So, what do you say?” the girl asked. “Do you think you’d like to join us?”

Hiroshi nodded eagerly. “Yes, I’d love to!”

The girl smiled again and handed him a card. “Great! Our next meeting is tomorrow night. Be there at eight o’clock sharp.”

Hiroshi took the card and put it in his pocket. He couldn’t believe what was happening. He was going to join"

[DISC] How to Solve Your Problems? - Oneshot,LMAO that last guy,"

There is no one-size-fits-all solution to solving problems. The best way to approach any problem is to first identify the problem. Once you know what the problem is, you can then begin to research possible solutions and develop a plan of action. It is important to be patient and systematic in your approach. Break the problem down into smaller parts and work through each part one at a time. If needed, seek help from a professional or mentor who can help guide you through the process. Finally, take action and don’t be afraid to make mistakes along the way. It is through trial and error that we find the best solutions."

The mother of the protagonist makes the snap decision to turn off the TV, as she can’t bear to watch her child attempt to do something that he can’t do. As he keeps trying to say the word, she is overcome with emotions and breaks down, likely because she feels as though she has failed her child, being unable to raise a deaf child properly (hence the guidebook).","

The young girl was sitting alone on a bench, her face streaked with tears. She was alone in the park, but not alone in her thoughts. 

She was thinking of all the things she had been through in her life, all the pain and suffering, and the loneliness. She had been through so much, yet no one ever seemed to understand her. 

The tears kept rolling down her cheeks as she thought of all the people who had hurt her and all the ways she had been let down. She felt so alone and helpless, and she had no one to turn to. 

Suddenly, she felt a gentle hand on her shoulder. She looked up to see an older man looking down at her with a kind smile on his face. He had seen her crying and had come over to see if she was okay. 

The kindness in his eyes made her burst into tears again, but this time, it was a different kind of cry. He listened patiently as she told him her story, and he simply nodded in understanding. 

When she had finished, he handed her a tissue and said, ""I'm sorry for all that you have gone through. But, you are not alone. There are people out there, like me, who care about you and want to help you. And, you can always talk to me if you need someone to listen.""

[DISC] What if you asked for a million times return on your Valentines gift? (Oneshot),Bro understood the mission and executed it perfectly,"

Nina was a hopeless romantic. She was always looking for ways to make her partner feel loved and appreciated, and Valentines Day was her favorite holiday.

This year she had gone all out, splurging on a diamond necklace for her partner. She had spent a small fortune on it, and when she presented it to him, she was expecting the usual appreciation and love that she always got from him.

But instead, he looked at it, then looked at her and said, ""What if I asked for a million times return on this gift?""

Nina was taken aback. She had never expected such a demand. She had put so much thought and effort into the necklace, and now her partner was asking for a million times return?

Nina was speechless for a moment, but then she said, ""I love you, and I want to show you how much I care. So, yes, I will give you a million times return on this gift.""

Her partner smiled, and they hugged and kissed. He thanked her for the necklace, and they shared a wonderful Valentines Day together.

Nina had learned a valuable lesson that day. Love is not about the material things, it's about the thought and effort that goes into them. No matter how much you give, it's the love that matters most."

Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Where Is the Outrage Over Anti-Semitism in Sports and Hollywood?,Kareem just cocked it back and yammed it on Stephen Jackson,"

Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is an outspoken advocate for social justice and has been a vocal critic of anti-Semitism in sports and Hollywood. In a recent op-ed for The Hollywood Reporter, Abdul-Jabbar expressed his concern that anti-Semitism is being overlooked in the sports world and in Hollywood. He noted that there have been few public condemnations of anti-Semitic incidents such as the recent vandalism of a Jewish cemetery in Philadelphia.

Abdul-Jabbar argued that a lack of outrage over anti-Semitism in the sports and entertainment industries is indicative of a larger problem. He believes that these industries are not doing enough to combat anti-Semitism and that there should be more public outcry when such incidents occur.

Abdul-Jabbar also calls for greater education about anti-Semitism and its history in order to prevent future incidents. He believes that if people are more aware of the dangers of anti-Semitism, then they will be less likely to tolerate it or to stay silent when it occurs."

Why isn't LeBron taking the same criticism for joining the Lakers that KD got when he joined GSW?,You fuckin boomed us,"

LeBron James is a four-time MVP and three-time champion, and he has been a consistent presence in the NBA Finals for eight consecutive seasons. Therefore, he is viewed differently than Kevin Durant, who had only won one championship prior to joining the Golden State Warriors. Additionally, Durant's decision to join a team that had already won a championship and was considered a ""superteam"" was seen as an act of betrayal by many fans who felt he was taking the easy way out. LeBron, on the other hand, is seen as taking on a challenge by joining a young, rebuilding Lakers team and attempting to turn them into a championship contender."

Could an Owner theoretically marry a player to circumvent the cap?,My fiancee says that getting married doesn't mean automatic access to the back end assets.,"

No, this would not be allowed. The rules of the National Football League (NFL) specifically prohibit team owners from entering into any kind of contract with players, including marriage. Therefore, attempting to circumvent the salary cap by marrying a player would be a violation of league rules."

Worst National Anthem of All-Time?,“Let’s play some basketball!”,"

The worst national anthem of all-time is widely considered to be the anthem of South Africa during its apartheid era, ""Die Stem Van Suid-Afrika"" (The Call of South Africa). The lyrics of the song glorified white supremacy and the Afrikaner nationalist movement, which ran counter to the values of freedom, equality, and democracy."
‘Stand With Hong Kong’? Not When N.B.A.’s Chinese Fortune Is on the Line,"This is a PR nightmare for the NBA, but they know it'll blow over In The US.","

The NBA is in a difficult position when it comes to the protests in Hong Kong. The league has a large presence in China, and it stands to lose a great deal of money if it openly supports the protesters. On the other hand, there is a moral imperative to stand in solidarity with the protesters and the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong. The NBA has tried to walk a tightrope between these two positions, but it has been met with criticism from both sides. The league has been accused of being too soft on China, while also being accused of not doing enough to support the protesters. Ultimately, the NBA must make a decision about whether or not it will stand with Hong Kong, and it must take into account both the moral and financial implications of such a decision."

"Take Isaiah Thomas, shrink him to 4'8, give him 50 lbs of pure muscle without losing any speed, add 2 feet to his wingspan, and 10 inches to the circumference of his head. How good is he now?",How high can it jump?,"

Isaiah Thomas is now an incredibly impressive player. His smaller size and added muscle would make him incredibly agile and fast on the court, and his extended wingspan would allow him to make plays and shots that would be impossible for other players. He would also have an advantage in rebounding and defending due to his increased head circumference. In short, he would be an absolute powerhouse on the court."

Kuz: where tf does Toronto keep finding these good ass undrafted players?,Our #0 >>>>>>>> Their #0,"

Toronto has a long history of finding undrafted players and giving them a chance to make an impact. The team's scouting and player development staff have been able to uncover gems in the undrafted free agent market by evaluating players who may have been overlooked by other teams. The Toronto Marlies of the AHL have been a great place to find talent, with players like Andreas Johnsson, Trevor Moore, and Travis Dermott all making the jump directly from the Marlies to the Leafs. Toronto has also made a habit of signing college free agents out of NCAA hockey programs, such as Chris Mueller, Zach Hyman, and Trevor Moore. Finally, the Leafs have had success in the CHL, signing undrafted players like Pierre Engvall and Adam Brooks."
