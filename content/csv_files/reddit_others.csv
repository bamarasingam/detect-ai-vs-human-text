What did luffy mean by this?,Idk but this maybe like top 3 moments for me
"One piece has been the only anime in my entire anime career to make me feel, and cry. This part where brook had to watch all his crewmates die one by one but still kept on singing breaks my heart.

[DISC] Why are you crying? - Oneshot (Silent Manga),"For the people (like me) that didn‚Äôt understand this comic the first time around:

The protagonist (male child) is attempting to say the word that the girl on the TV is saying that makes the mother on the TV smile. The mother of the protagonist makes the snap decision to turn off the TV, as she can‚Äôt bear to watch her child attempt to do something that he can‚Äôt do. As he keeps trying to say the word, she is overcome with emotions and breaks down, likely because she feels as though she has failed her child, being unable to raise a deaf child properly (hence the guidebook)."
